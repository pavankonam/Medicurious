Prolonged shock can\nresult in cellular dysfunction and irreversible organ failure. Mortality is high without early diagnosis and treatment.\nClinical features\nShock should be suspected in patients with:\nSign(s) of hypotension: weak pulse, low or declining blood pressure (BP) a , narrow pulse pressure\nAcute onset of signs of tissue hypoperfusion:\nSkin: pallor, mottled skin, sweating, cold extremities or lower limb temperature gradient b , capillary refill time\n(CRT) \u2265 3 seconds\nLungs: tachypnea, dyspnoea\nHeart: tachycardia, which often occurs before BP decreases\nKidney: oliguria (urine output < 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hour) or anuria\nBrain: thirst, anxiety, agitation, confusional state, apathy, altered mental status\nIn children, accurate BP measurement is difficult, and hypotension is a very late sign of shock. Therefore, critically ill\nchildren c should be treated for shock if they present at least one of the following signs: lower limb temperature\ngradient b , CRT \u2265 3 seconds, weak radial pulse or severe tachycardia d [1] .\nClinical features may vary according to the type of shock [2] :\nPage 11 / 409\nType Specific clinical features Risk factors\nAnaphylaxis: likely when either of the following 2 Recent exposure to an allergen\ncriteria develop within minutes to hours [3] : (e.g. food, sting, medicine) or\nInvolvement of skin and/or mucous membranes (e.g. history of anaphylaxis\ngeneralised urticaria, itching, flushing, swollen\nlips/tongue/uvula) AND \u2265 1 of the following:\nrespiratory symptoms (wheeze, dyspnoea);\nDistributive low BP or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction\nSevere vasodilation (hypotonia, incontinence);\nand increased capillary severe gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal\npermeability resulting pain, repetitive vomiting).\nin maldistribution of Hypotension, bronchospasm or laryngeal\nblood flow involvement (stridor, vocal changes, odynophagia)\nafter exposure to known or probable allergen for\nthat patient.\nSeptic shock: signs of infection, fever or Infection, recent surgery,\nhypothermia, altered mental status, dyspnoea, immunodeficiency\npersisting hypotension despite fluid resuscitation [4]\nIschaemia: chest pain, dyspnoea History of cardiac disease,\nArrhythmia advanced age\nCardiogenic Murmur of valvular heart disease\nCardiac pump failure\nAcute heart failure: see Heart failure in adults, Chapter History of cardiac disease, viral\n12. illness, immunodeficiency\nHypovolaemic Haemorrhagic: external bleeding, signs and symptoms Trauma, recent surgery, obstetric\nDirect blood/fluid loss of internal bleeding, hypotension (a) haemorrhage\nor fluid sequestration\ninto the extravascular\nNon-haemorrhagic: dry mouth, absence of tears, Profuse diarrhoea and/or\nspace resulting in\nsunken eyes/fontanelle, low jugular venous pressure vomiting, intestinal obstruction\ndecreased\n(JVP), altered mental status\nintravascular volume\nPulmonary embolism (PE): chest pain, tachycardia, Recent surgery or immobilisation,\ntachypnoea, hypoxia cancer, history of PE or DVT\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT): leg pain, swelling, warmth\nObstructive\nObstruction to blood\nTension pneumothorax: decreased breath sounds, Trauma, invasive medical\nflow to, or from, the\nraised JVP, weak radial pulse, tracheal deviation procedure\nheart or great vessels\nCardiac tamponade: pulsus paradoxus (b) , raised JVP, Trauma, immunodeficiency\nnarrow pulse pressure, muffled heart sounds\n(a) In children and young adults with hypovolaemic shock, BP may be maintained initially, but subsequently declines rapidly if\nfluid loss is not replaced.\nPage 12 / 409\n(b) Pulsus paradoxus is measured by taking the patient's BP during both expiration and inspiration. It is defined as a decrease\nof > 10 mmHg in the SBP during inspiration compared with expiration.\nManagement\nAttend to the patient immediately even if the type of shock is not known. Call for help. Move to critical care unit if\npossible.\nAssess and manage A (airway), B (breathing), and C (circulation) according to Basic Life Support (see below). If\nanaphylaxis is suspected, immediately go to specific management.\nTake a rapid history to try to determine underlying cause.\nMonitor:\nurine output hourly (insert a urinary catheter)\nHR, RR, BP, temperature, CRT, SpO , and level of consciousness\n2\nPerform the following tests:\nhaemoglobin and blood glucose level\nmalaria rapid diagnostic test in endemic area: see Malaria, Chapter 6\nblood culture (if available) and blood group\nIn children, administer ceftriaxone IV e : one dose of 80 mg/kg. Reassess need for further antibiotic treatment\naccording to underlying cause.\nTreat pain: see Pain, Chapter 1.\nPrimary objective of shock management is to restore adequate tissue perfusion, demonstrated by:\nReturning vital signs, CRT, SpO , mental status, etc. to normal.\n2\nMaintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) f > 65 mmHg in adults (or higher if patient has pre-existing hypertension).\nMaintaining urine output > 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hour.\nAfter initial management:\nTake a more detailed history.\nPerform a comprehensive physical examination.\nIn case of dehydration: see Dehydration, Chapter 1.\nIn case of blunt thoracic or abdominal trauma, perform POCUS g : (e)FAST exam to evaluate for pneumothorax or\nfree fluid in pleural, pericardial and/or peritoneal spaces. Refer to surgeon as required.\nOn-going care:\nRe-evaluate patient\u2019s condition and response to treatment every 10 minutes until patient is stable.\nPerform a second comprehensive physical examination.\nInitiate nutritional support adapted to patient's needs as soon as possible and reassess regularly. Patients have high\nprotein and energy requirements. Enteral route is preferred.\nBasic Life Support\n1) Manage airways and breathing\nLay the patient on their back. However:\nif spinal trauma is suspected, do not move the patient;\nin case of anaphylaxis, the patient may prefer a sitting position.\nIn case of altered mental status:\nbe prepared with mask and bag if needed for ventilation;\nremove any airway obstruction (e.g. secretions, foreign body);\nopen airway: stand at head of bed, place one hand on the forehead and gently tilt the head back.\nSimultaneously, place the fingertips of the other hand under the chin and lift the chin. If suspicion of spinal\ntrauma, do not move the neck. Instead, place heels of both hands on patient\u2019s parietal areas, and use index and\nmiddle fingers of both hands to push the angle of mandible anteriorly (jaw thrust)\nPage 13 / 409\nif needed, insert an oropharyngeal airway.\nAuscultate lungs to assess ventilation.\nAdminister 10 to 15 litres/minute of oxygen with mask to maintain SpO > 94%.\n2\nIf SpO remains \u2264 94% with oxygen, see If resources allow.\n2\n2) Maintain circulation\nControl bleeding:\napply direct manual pressure and/or compression/haemostatic dressing to the wound;\nin case of massive life-threatening bleeding from an extremity (e.g. leg) not controlled by direct pressure: apply a\nwindlass tourniquet h [5] .\nInsert 2 peripheral IV lines (catheters 20-22G in children and 14-18G in adults) or an intraosseous (IO) needle.\nAdminister Ringer lactate (RL) i , glucose 5%-Ringer lactate (G5%-RL) j , and/or blood, following specific\nmanagement described below. Reassess before giving additional fluid therapy. Monitor for fluid overload k ,\nespecially in patients at risk, e.g. severely malnourished children; patients with severe malaria, heart disease, severe\nanaemia; older patients.\nMaintain normal body temperature.\nIf unable to maintain BP, see If resources allow.\nAnaphylaxis\nRemove exposure to causal agent.\nAdminister epinephrine (adrenaline) IM into the mid-anterolateral thigh. Use undiluted solution and a 1 ml syringe\ngraduated in 0.01 ml [6] :\nChildren under 6 months: 0.1 to 0.15 ml\nChildren 6 months to 5 years: 0.15 ml\nChildren 6 to 12 years: 0.3 ml\nChildren over 12 years l and adults: 0.5 ml\nRepeat after 5 minutes if no or poor clinical improvement (up to a total of 3 IM injections).\nMonitor HR, BP, CRT and clinical response.\nIn case of stridor, administer nebulized epinephrine: 0.5 mg/kg/dose (max. 5 mg) in 5 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride\nover 10 to 15 minutes\nIf SpO is < 94%, ventilate with bag mask.\n2\nAdminister a bolus of RL:\nChildren: 10 ml/kg as quickly as possible\nAdults: 500 ml as quickly as possible\nRepeat bolus once if signs of poor perfusion persist after 15 minutes.\nIf shock persists after 3 IM injections of epinephrine, in particular if unable to maintain BP, see If ressources allow.\nAfter initial treatment with epinephrine and IV fluids, some patients (e.g. patients requiring continuing treatment after\n2 doses of epinephrine IM or patients with ongoing asthma or shock) may benefit from a short course of\ncorticosteroid therapy. When the patient is stable, prednisolone PO : 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) once daily in the\nmorning for 3 to 5 days. Use an IV corticosteroid only if the patient cannot take oral treatment.\nSeptic shock\nLook for source of infection. If possible, take specimens for culture before starting antibiotic treatment.\nFluid therapy:\nChildren and adolescents under 15 years: G5%-RL solution as maintenance fluids (see Appendix 1)\nAdolescents 15 years and over and adults: one bolus of 250 to 500 ml of RL as quickly as possible\nAntibiotic treatment:\nStart antibiotics according to the suspected origin of infection within 1 hour of presentation [7] (see tables\nbelow).\nPage 14 / 409\nIf source is unknown, administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and\nanaerobic bacteria. If possible, take into account local epidemiology (rates and types of resistance).\nDifferentiate community acquired sepsis and nosocomial sepsis as pathogens and rates of resistance may be\ndifferent. Simplify the antibiotic treatment (to narrower spectrum) whenever possible.\nReassess treatment daily:\nIf culture results are available: adapt treatment accordingly.\nIf improvement after 24 to 48 hours: change to oral route, however some foci (e.g. meningitis) require\nprolonged IV treatment.\nIf no improvement after 48 to 96 hours: consider resistant pathogen m , in particular in patients with\nimmunodeficiency or recent (in the last month) hospitalisation or antibiotic use and adapt treatment\naccordingly.\nOther measures to control infection:\nIf suspected catheter-related infection, insert a new catheter in another site and remove the suspected\ncatheter.\nDrain soft-tissue abscess (see Cutaneous abscess, Chapter 10); irrigate and debride traumatic wounds. Refer to\nsurgeon if needed for debridement, drainage, relieving obstruction, etc.\nTreatment of fever: see Fever, Chapter 1.\nPage 15 / 409\nOrigin Antibiotics Alternatives (c)\ncloxacillin cefazolin

Titrate according to patient's clinical situation. Refer to\nmanagement objectives (including BP) under Management.\nNorepinephrine (NEP) tartrate (i) Epinephrine (EPN) (adrenaline)\nChildren: 2nd choice Children: 1st choice\nIndication\nAdults: 1st choice Adults: 2nd choice\nChildren: Children:\nAdd 1 ml (2 mg) of NEP tartrate to 39 ml Add 2 ml (2 mg) of EPN to 38 ml of 0.9% NaCl\nof 0.9% NaCl to obtain a 0.05 mg/ml (50 to obtain a 0.05 mg/ml (50 micrograms/ml)\nPreparation\nmicrograms/ml) solution. solution.\nof\ndiluted\nAdults: Adults:\nsolution (j)\nAdd 2 ml (4 mg) of NEP tartrate to 38 ml Add 4 ml (4 mg) of EPN to 36 ml of 0.9% NaCl\nof 0.9% NaCl to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml (100 to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml (100 micrograms/ml)\nmicrograms/ml) solution. solution.\nStarting 0.1 microgram/kg/minute\nrate (k)\nRate for Increase by 0.05 micrograms/kg/minute every 10 minutes for the first hour, then every hour.\nincreasing (k) Max. 1 microgram/kg/minute.\nRate for Taper down doses when management objectives are attained. Do not stop abruptly.\ndecreasing (k) Decrease by 0.05 micrograms/kg/minute every hour.\n(i) 2 mg of NEP tartrate = 1 mg of NEP base.\n(j) 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose or RL can be used for dilution.\n(k) The infusion rate is calculated as follows: [desired dose (microgram/kg/min) x weight (kg) x 60 min] \u00f7 concentration\n(microgram/ml).\nOngoing care: measure serum potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate levels and correct any\nabnormalities. Additional investigations (e.g. X-rays, other laboratory tests) may be indicated, depending on\naetiology suspected.\nPage 19 / 409\nFootnotes\n(a) Hypotension is based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults: SBP < 90 mmHg or decrease in SBP \u2265 40 mmHg from\nbaseline or mean arterial pressure MAP < 65 mmHg. Shock is often accompanied by hypotension but may also occur with\nnormal or elevated BP.\n(b) Run the back of the hand from the toe to the knee. A notable temperature change from the cold foot to the warm knee is a\npositive temperature gradient, indicating distal hypoperfusion.\n(c) Critically ill-appearing child: weak grunting or crying, drowsy and difficult to arouse, does not smile, disconjugate or anxious\ngaze, pallor or cyanosis, general hypotonia.\n(d) Children under 1 year: > 180 bpm; Children 1 to 5 years: > 160 bpm; Children 5 years and over: > 140 bpm.\n(e) For IV administration of ceftriaxone, dissolve only in water for injection.\n(f) MAP = diastolic BP (DBP) + 1/3 (SBP-DBP). A patient with BP 90/60 has a MAP = 60 + 1/3 (90-60) = 70.\n(g) POCUS should only be performed and interpreted by trained clinicians.\n(h) The patient should receive surgery within 1 hour of the application of a windlass tourniquet. After 1 hour, there is a risk of\nischaemic injury of the limb. If surgery is not possible and the tourniquet is required to save the patient\u2019s life, it should be\nleft in place. Any tourniquet that has been applied for more than 6 hours should be left in place until arrival at a facility\ncapable of providing definitive surgical care.\n(i) Crystalloids should be used. Colloids (e.g. modified fluid gelatin, albumin) are not recommended.\n(j) Remove 50 ml of RL from a 500 ml RL bottle or bag, then add 50 ml of 50% glucose to the remaining 450 ml of RL to obtain\n500 ml of 5% glucose-RL solution.\n(k) In case of fluid overload: sit the patient up, reduce the infusion rate to a minimum and administer furosemide IV (0.5 mg/kg in\nchildren; 40 mg in adults). Monitor the patient closely over 30 minutes and assess for underlying cardiorespiratory or renal\ndisease. Once the patient is stabilised, reassess the necessity of continuing IV fluids. If IV fluids are still required, re-start at\nhalf the previous infusion rate and monitor closely.\n(l) If small or prepubertal children, administer 0.3 ml of epinephrine.\n(m) For example: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), pseudomonas species, and gram-negative bacteria with\nextended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) activity.\n(n) When using a peripheral vein, monitor infusion site closely for signs of extravasation, in particular in young children.\n(o) If no system to control volume delivery and flow rate (e.g. syringe pump), an infusion using an infusion bag and standard\npaediatric giving set can be considered in extreme situations as a temporary measure. However, it is important to consider\nthe risks related to this type of administration (accidental bolus or insufficient dose). The infusion must be constantly\nmonitored to prevent any, even small, change from the prescribed rate.\nReferences\n1. Houston KA, George EC, Maitland K.

They result from abnormal brain activity.\nMost seizures are brief (less than 5 minutes) and resolve spontaneously. They may occur once or may recur.\nIn young children, seizures frequently occur in the context of fever, with no underlying causes. These are defined as\n\"febrile seizures\".\nA seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or 2 or more seizures in 5 minutes without complete restoration of baseline\nconsciousness between seizures is defined as \"status epilepticus\" [1] [2] . Status epilepticus is a medical emergency\nrequiring immediate management. The longer a seizure lasts, the more difficult it is to stop, and the greater the risk\nfor permanent brain damage and death.\nIn pregnancy and the postpartum period, seizures may be a manifestation of eclampsia. Refer to Essential obstetric\nand newborn care, MSF.\nClinical features\nDuring a seizure\ncontraction of muscles, including respiratory muscles (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic jerking of the arms and\nlegs (clonic phase)\nand\nloss of consciousness\nThese signs may be associated with loss of urine, breathing difficulty, and cyanosis.\nImmediately after a seizure (postictal phase)\nThe patient experiences fatigue and temporary symptoms such as confusional state, headache, memory loss, focal\ndeficits. Recovery usually occurs within 30 to 60 minutes [3] but may be delayed.\nFirst aid during a seizure\nNote the time. Call for help.\nProtect from falls and trauma, loosen clothing.\nMaintain airway, place patient in recovery position to avoid aspiration, do not put anything in the mouth.\nTreat hypoglycaemia if present or administer glucose if unable to measure capillary blood glucose\nimmediately (see Hypoglycaemia, Chapter 1).\nDepending on the context:\nAdminister oxygen if available.\nIf febrile seizures are likely, see Febrile seizures.\nIn adults, thiamine (100 mg by IV infusion in 100 ml 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes) may be administered at the\nsame time as glucose if vitamin B deficiency is suspected (e.g. in case of alcohol-related seizures) a .\n1\nIf seizures stop spontaneously in 5 minutes or less, see Postictal management.\nFebrile seizures\nPage 22 / 409\nFebrile seizures frequently occur in children aged 6 months to 5 years with fever (usually due to viral infection) and no\nsigns of central nervous system (CNS) infection, metabolic disturbances, or history of afebrile seizures [4] . They may be\neither \"simple\" or \"complex\".\nA simple febrile seizure is defined as a single generalised seizure, without focal signs, that lasts less than 15 minutes,\nand does not recur within a 24-hour period [4] . Most of these seizures last less than 5 minutes and if so,\nno antiseizure treatment is required. The risk of subsequent epilepsy is low after this type of seizure. Observe the\nchild at least until full recovery, and discharge when child returns to neurological baseline. Give instructions for\nhome-based management: symptomatic treatment of fever to make the child more comfortable (see Fever,\nChapter 1) and of underlying viral infection if relevant.\nA complex febrile seizure is a seizure meeting at least one the following criteria: presence of focal signs, a duration\nmore than 15 minutes, or multiple seizures within a 24-hour period [4] .\nIn all cases:\nProvide first aid during a seizure.\nAfter a seizure, see Postictal management.\nIf a seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or recurs within 5 minutes, start treatment for status epilepticus.\nStatus epilepticus\nIn case of status epilepticus, start antiseizure medication (ASM).\nASMs may cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially in children\nand older patients.\nDuring and after ASM administration:\nhave ventilation equipment (Ambu and mask) and solutions for fluid replacement ready for use,\nmonitor RR, SpO , HR, and BP at least every 15 minutes until stable.\n2\nNever administer ASMs by rapid IV injection. Reduce the administration rate in the event of drop in RR,\nHR, or BP.\nStep 1 - First-line ASM treatment\nAdminister one of the following benzodiazepines (BZD). The choice depends on the situation, i.e. if seizures occur\nin pre-hospital or hospital setting.\nIn any case, do not administer more than 2 doses of BZD.\nStatus epilepticus in pre-hospital setting\nAdminister midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal\nroute. For doses to be administered, see Table 1.\nIf seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose.\nIf seizures do not stop after the second dose of BZD, refer urgently to hospital for treatment with second-line\nASM(s).\nIf seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD, refer to hospital for further management (aetiologic treatment and\npotential maintenance treatment).\nWhile awaiting transfer, monitor vital signs, administer oxygen if available to maintain SpO > 94%. If seizures stop,\n2\nsee Postictal management.\nStatus epilepticus in hospital setting\nPage 23 / 409\nCheck whether a BZD has been administered before arrival at the hospital and the number of doses. If one dose was\nadministered, give a second dose. If 2 doses were administered, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.\nIf no pre-hospital dose of BZD was administered:\nIf IV or IO access: diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by slow IV injection (over 3 to 5 minutes). For doses to be\nadministered, see Table 1.\nIf no IV or IO access: midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or midazolam (1 mg/ml solution)\nby IM route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. For doses to be administered, see Table 1.\nIf seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose.\nIf seizures do not stop after the second dose of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.\nIf seizures recur:\n6 hours or more after seizures stop, restart treatment from Step 1 - First-line ASM treatment as for a new\nseizure,\nLess than 6 hours after seizures stop, continue treatment at the last point, e.g.:\nif seizures recur < 6 hours after a first dose of BZD, readminister the same dose,\nif seizures recur < 6 hours after 2 doses of BZD, start Step 2 - Second-line ASM treatment.\nIf seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD and do not recur, see Postictal management and evaluate the need for\nmaintenance ASM treatment.\nTable 1 - Dosage of benzodiazepines\nAge 1 to < 4 4 to < 12 1 to < 3 3 to < 5 5 to < 9 9 to < 12 \u2265 12 years\nmonths months years years years years adults\nWeight 3 to < 6 6 to < 10 10 to < 15 15 to < 20 20 to < 30 30 to < 40 \u2265 40 kg\nkg kg kg kg kg kg\nmidazolam buccal (a) or intranasal route (b) , dose in ml (5 mg/ml solution)\n0.25 ml 0.4 ml 0.6 ml 1 ml 1.2 ml 2 ml 2 ml\nmidazolam IM route, dose in ml (1 mg/ml solution)\n0.6 ml 1.2 ml 2 ml 3 ml 4 ml 6 ml 10 ml\ndiazepam rectal route (c) , dose in ml (5 mg/ml solution)\n0.4 ml 0.7 ml 1.2 ml 1.5 ml 2 ml 2 ml 2 to 4 ml (d)\ndiazepam slow IV route, dose in ml (5 mg/ml solution)\n0.25 ml 0.4 ml 0.6 ml 1 ml 1.2 ml 2 ml 2 ml (d)\n(a) Midazolam buccal route: lay the patient on their side. Withdraw the required dose using a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe. Remove the\nneedle. Insert the tip of the syringe into the space between the gum and cheek. Administer the dose by slowly pushing the\nsyringe plunger.\n(b) Midazolam intranasal route: lay the patient on their back or side. Withdraw the required dose using a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe\n(add an additional 0.1 ml to the calculated dose to account for the remaining liquid in the atomising device). Remove the\nneedle. Attach the intranasal atomisation device to the syringe. Briskly push the syringe plunger to spray the dose into the\nnostril. The dose can be split in both nostrils to reduce irritation.\n(c) Diazepam rectal route: lay the patient on their side. For volumes up to 1 ml, use a 1 ml syringe. Withdraw the required dose.\nRemove the needle. Insert the syringe into the rectum for a length of 1 to 3 cm (depending on age) to administer the dose.\nFor volumes greater than 1 ml, use a 2 ml syringe and attach to the tip of the syringe a nasogastric tube n\u00b08 cut to a length\nof 2 to 3 cm to administer the dose. After administration, hold the buttocks together for at least one minute.\nPage 24 / 409\n(d) In patients \u2265 65 years: for diazepam rectal, do not exceed 2 ml (= 10 mg) per dose; for diazepam IV, reduce the dose by half\n(1 ml = 5 mg per dose).\nStep 2 - Second-line ASM treatment\nPatients with no known epilepsy\nSecond-line ASMs are indicated for:\nChildren, if seizures do not stop within 5 minutes of second dose of BZD.\nAll adults, even if seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of BZD, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly\ntreated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances).\nThe choice of the ASM depends on the patient\u2019s characteristics: age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, and\ncomorbidities. See Table 2.\nFor doses to be administered, see Table 3\nTable 2 - Choice of a second-line antiseizure medication\nChildren 1 month to < 2 years Girls 2 to < 10 years\nGirls \u2265 10 years and women Boys \u2265 2 years and men\nFirst choice levetiracetam (LEV) (e) levetiracetam (LEV) (e) or\nvalproic acid (VPA) (f)\nSecond choice phenobarbital (PB) (g) phenobarbital (PB) (g)\nThird choice phenytoin (PHT) (h) phenytoin (PHT) (h)\n(e) LEV can be used in all patients but with caution in patients with renal impairment or heart disorders.\n(f) VPA is contraindicated:\n\u2022 in children under 2 years and patients with hepatic disease;\n\u2022 in women and girls who are or may become pregnant. Every effort should be made to find a safer alternative to VPA in\npregnant women and girls. However, prolonged status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition both for the mother and\nthe unborn child. If VPA is the only ASM available, use the lowest possible dose.\n(g) PB is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. It should be administered\nwith caution in children, older patients and patients with mild to moderate impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic\nfunction.\n(h) PHT is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, atrioventricular block. It should be administered with caution in\npatients with hepatic impairment, heart failure, cardiac rhythm disorders, hypotension.\nIf seizures do not stop after second-line ASM, change to another second-line ASM.\nIf seizures do not stop or recur in < 6 hours despite 2 second-line ASMs, transfer the patient to an intensive care\nunit for treatment of refractory status epilepticus.\nIf seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line ASM(s), see Postictal management and Maintenance ASM treatment.\nPatients with known epilepsy\nHistory taking:\nASM and dose taken, effectiveness.\nMissed doses if any, and reason (e.g. forgetting, interruption due to adverse effects, shortage of medication).\nManagement:\nAdminister the IV loading dose of the medication that the patient should usually take or see Table 2.\nPage 25 / 409\nIf seizures do not stop, continue treatment as for patients with no known epilepsy.\nIf seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line ASM(s), see Postictal management and Maintenance ASM treatment.\nStep 3 - Maintenance ASM treatment\nSome patients may require maintenance treatment after the loading dose.\nIn children, maintenance treatment is indicated when:\na second-line ASM has been used to control seizures, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly\ntreated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances),\n3 or more seizures occur within a 24-hour period,\nfocal signs and/or impaired consciousness persist beyond expected postictal period,\nthere is known or presumed traumatic brain injury (within 24 hours of injury),\nthere is known or presumed epilepsy.\nUnless the child has already received a loading dose, start with a loading dose, see Table 3.\nIn adults, maintenance treatment is indicated for all patients, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly\ntreated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances).\nIf seizures do not recur, administer maintenance treatment for 48 to 72 hours and then reassess. Use oral route (or\nnasogastric tube). For maintenance doses to be administered, see Table 3.\nFor seizures in the context of head trauma, maintenance treatment should last 7 days.\nIn case of epilepsy, start or resume long-term treatment. See Epilepsy, Chapter 12.\nPostictal management\nNote time of end of seizure; keep patient in recovery position; maintain airway.\nAdminister oxygen to all patients if available and especially to patients who received ASM(s). Maintain SpO > 94%.\n2\nMonitor vital signs and SpO every 15 minutes until stable, then every hour.\n2\nClosely monitor RR if the patient received BZD, PB or PHT; HR and BP (and ECG if available) if the patient\nreceived PHT.\nObserve for further seizures.\nAs soon as possible, try to identify the underlying cause and treat it, even in patients with known epilepsy (see\nFrequent causes of seizures):\nTake a detailed history and perform a full clinical examination, looking particularly for general status and focal\nsigns.\nDepending on assessment, perform the following tests if available:\ncapillary blood glucose, especially if not done during the seizure.

It is expressed differently by each patient depending on cultural\nbackground, age, etc. It is a subjective experience meaning that only the individual is able to assess his/her level of pain.\nRegular assessment of the intensity of pain is indispensable in establishing effective treatment.\nClinical features\nPain assessment\nIntensity: use a simple verbal scale in children over 5 years and adults, and NFCS or FLACC scales in children less\nthan 5 years (see Pain evaluation scales).\nPattern: sudden, intermittent, chronic; at rest, at night, on movement, during care procedures, etc.\nCharacter: burning, cramping, spasmodic, radiating, etc.\nAggravating or relieving factors, etc.\nClinical examination\nOf the organ or area where the pain is located.\nSpecific signs of underlying disease (e.g. bone or osteoarticular pain may be caused by a vitamin C deficiency) and\nreview of all systems.\nAssociated signs (fever, weight loss, etc.).\nSynthesis\nThe synthesis of information gathered during history taking and clinical examination allows aetiological diagnosis and\norients treatment. It is important to distinguish:\nNociceptive pain: it presents most often as acute pain and the cause-effect relationship is usually obvious (e.g.\nacute post-operative pain, burns, trauma, renal colic, etc.). The pain may be present in different forms, but\nneurological exam is normal. Treatment is relatively well standardized.\nNeuropathic pain, due to a nerve lesion (section, stretching, ischaemia): most often chronic pain. On a background\nof constant, more or less localized pain, such as paraesthesia or burning, there are recurrent acute attacks such as\nelectric shock-like pain, frequently associated with disordered sensation (anaesthesia, hypo or hyperaesthesia).\nThis type of pain is linked to viral infections directly affecting the CNS (herpes simplex, herpes zoster), neural\ncompression by tumors, post- amputation pain, paraplegia, etc.\nMixed pain (cancer, HIV) for which management requires a broader approach.\nPain evaluation scales\nSelf-evaluation scale - Children over 5 years and adults\nSimple verbal scale (SVS)\nIntensity No Mild Moderate\nSevere pain\nof pain pain pain pain\nScoring 0 1 2 3\nWrite down 0 + ++ +++\nPage 38 / 409\nObservational evaluation scale - Children 2 months-5 years\nFLACC scale (Face Limb Activity Cry Consolability)\nScoring\nItems\n0 1 2\nFace No particular Occasional grimace or frown, withdrawn, Frequent to constant frown,\nexpression or smile disinterested clenched jaw, quivering chin\nLegs Normal position or Uneasy, restless, tense Kicking, or legs drawn up\nrelaxed\nActivity Lying quietly, normal Squirming, shifting back and forth, tense Arched, rigid or jerking\nposition, moves easily\nCry No cry (awake or Moans or whimpers, occasional Crying steadily, screams or\nasleep) complaint sobs, frequent complaints\nConsolability Content, relaxed Reassured by occasional touching, Difficult to console or comfort\nhugging or being talked to, distractible\nEach category is scored from 0 to 2, giving a final score between 0 and 10.\n0 to 3: mild pain, 4 to 7: moderate pain, 7 to 10: severe pain\nObservational evaluation scale - Children under 2 months\nNFCS scale (Neonatal Facial Coding System)\nScoring\nItems\n0 1\nBrow bulge no yes\nEye squeeze no yes\nNasolabial furrow no yes\nOpen lips no yes\nA score of 2 or more signifies significant pain, requiring analgesic treatment.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the type and intensity of the pain. It may be both aetiological and symptomatic if a treatable\ncause is identified. Treatment is symptomatic only in other cases (no cause found, non-curable disease).\nPage 39 / 409\nNociceptive pain\nThe WHO classifies analgesics used for this type of pain on a three-step ladder:\nStep 1: non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nStep 2: weak opioid analgesics such as codeine and tramadol. Their combination with one or two Step 1 analgesics\nis recommended.\nStep 3: strong opioid analgesics, first and foremost morphine. Their combination with one or two Step 1 analgesics\nis recommended.\nThe treatment of pain is based on a few fundamental concepts:\nPain can only be treated correctly if it is correctly evaluated. The only person who can evaluate the intensity of pain\nis the patient himself. The use of pain assessment scales is invaluable.\nThe pain evaluation observations should be recorded in the patient chart in the same fashion as other vital signs.\nTreatment of pain should be as prompt as possible.\nIt is recommended to administer analgesics in advance when appropriate (e.g. before painful care procedures).\nAnalgesics should be prescribed and administered at fixed time intervals (not on demand).\nOral forms should be used whenever possible.\nThe combination of different analgesic drugs (multimodal analgesia) is advantageous.\nStart with an analgesic from the level presumed most effective: e.g., in the event of a fractured femur, start with a\nStep 3 analgesic.\nThe treatment and dose chosen are guided by the assessment of pain intensity, but also by the patient\u2019s response\nwhich may vary significantly from one person to another.\nTreatment of acute pain\nMild pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID\nModerate pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID + tramadol or codeine\nSevere pain Paracetamol + /- NSAID + morphine\nPage 40 / 409\nAdults (except\nAnalgesics Children pregnant/breast-feeding Remarks\nwomen)\nLevel paracetamol < 1 month: 10 mg/kg 1 g every 6 to 8 hours (max.

Its analgesic effect is dosedependent. Its\nadverse effects have often been exaggerated and should not be an obstacle to its use.\nThe most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression, which may be fatal. This adverse effect\nresults from overdose. It is, therefore, important to increase doses gradually. Respiratory depression is preceded by\ndrowsiness, which is a warning to monitor respiratory rate (RR).\nThe RR should remain equal to or greater than the thresholds indicated below:\nChildren 1 to 12 months RR \u2265 25 respirations/minute\nChildren 1 to 2 years RR \u2265 20 respirations/minute\nChildren 2 to 5 years RR \u2265 15 respirations/minute\nChildren > 5 years and adults RR \u2265 10 respirations/minute\nRespiratory depression must be identified and treated quickly: verbal and physical stimulation of the patient;\nadministration of oxygen; respiratory support (bag and mask) if necessary. If no improvement, administer naloxone\n(antagonist of morphine) in bolus to be repeated every minute until RR normalises and the excessive drowsiness\nresolves: 5 micrograms/kg in children and 1 to 3 micrograms/kg in adults.\nMorphine and codeine always cause constipation. A laxative should be prescribed if the opioid treatment continues\nmore than 48 hours. Lactulose PO is the drug of choice: children < 1 year: 5 ml daily; children 1-6 years: 5 to 10 ml\ndaily; children 7-14 years: 10 to 15 ml daily; adults: 15 to 45 ml daily.\nPage 42 / 409\nIf the patient\u2019s stools are soft, a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl PO: children > 3 years: 5 to 10 mg once daily; adults:\n10 to 15 mg once daily) is preferred.\nNausea and vomiting are common at the beginning of treatment.\nChildren:\nondansetron PO: 0.15 mg/kg (max. 4 mg per dose) up to 3 times daily\nDo not use metoclopramide in children.\nAdults:\nhaloperidol PO (2 mg/ml oral solution): 1 to 2 mg up to 6 times daily or metoclopramide PO: 5 to 10 mg 3 times\ndaily with an interval of at least 6 hours between each dose\nDo not combine haloperidol and metoclopramide.\nFor chronic pain in late stage disease (cancer, AIDS etc.), morphine PO is the drug of choice. It may be necessary to\nincrease doses over time according to pain assessment. Do not hesitate to give sufficient and effective doses.\nMorphine, tramadol and codeine have similar modes of action and should not be combined.\nBuprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine must not be combined with morphine, pethidine, tramadol or codeine\nbecause they have competitive action.\nTreatment of nociceptive pain in pregnant and breast-feeding women\nPregnancy\nBreast-feeding\nAnalgesics 0-5 From 6th month\nmonths\nparacetamol first first choice first choice\nLevel choice\n1\naspirin avoid contra-indicated avoid\nibuprofen avoid contra-indicated possible\ncodeine possible The neonate may develop withdrawal Use with caution, for a short period\nsymptoms, respiratory depression and (2-3 days), at the lowest effective\ndrowsiness in the event of prolonged dose.

Reduce the dose by half in elderly patients.\ncarbamazepine PO\nAdults: 200 mg once daily at bedtime (Week 1); 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 2); 200 mg 3 times daily (as of Week 3)\nGiven its teratogenic risk, carbamazepine should only be used in women of childbearing age when covered\nby effective contraception (intrauterine device or injectable progestogen). It is not recommended in pregnant women.\nMixed pain\nIn mixed pain with a significant component of nociceptive pain, such as in cancer or AIDS, morphine is combined with\nantidepressants and antiepileptics.\nChronic pain\nIn contrast to acute pain, medical treatment alone is not always sufficient in controlling chronic pain. A multidisciplinary\napproach including medical treatment, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and nursing is often necessary to allow good pain\nrelief and encourage patient selfmanagement.\nCo-analgesics\nThe combination of certain drugs may be useful or even essential in the treatment of pain: antispasmodics, muscle\nrelaxants, anxiolytics, corticosteroids, local anaesthesia, etc.\nPage 44 / 409\nAnaemia\nLast updated: January 2024\nAnaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) level below reference values [1] [2] , which vary depending on age, sex, and\npregnancy status (see Table 2).\nAnaemia may be caused by:\nDecreased production of red blood cells: iron deficiency, nutritional deficiencies (folic acid, vitamin B , vitamin A),\n12\ndepressed bone marrow function, certain infections (HIV, visceral leishmaniasis), renal failure;\nLoss of red blood cells: acute or chronic haemorrhage (gastrointestinal ulcer, ancylostomiasis, schistosomiasis,\netc.);\nIncreased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis): parasitic (malaria), bacterial and viral (HIV) infections;\nhaemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease, thalassaemia); intolerance to certain drugs (primaquine, dapsone, co-\ntrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, etc.) in patients with G6PD deficiency.\nThe causes of anaemia are often interlinked.\nClinical features\nCommon signs: pallor of the conjunctivae, mucous membranes, palms of hands and soles of feet; fatigue,\ndizziness, dyspnoea, tachycardia, heart murmur.\nSigns of decompensation: cold extremities, altered mental status, oedema in the lower limbs, respiratory distress,\nelevated jugular venous pressure, cardiac/coronary failure, shock.\nSignificant signs: cheilosis and glossitis (nutritional deficiency), jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dark coloured urine\n(haemolysis), bleeding (maelena, haematuria, etc.), signs of malaria (Chapter 6), etc.\nLaboratory\nHb levels\nRapid diagnostic test or thick and thin blood films in areas where malaria is endemic.\nUrinary dipstick: check for haemoglobinuria or haematuria.\nIf sickle cell disease is suspected (to be done before blood transfusion): rapid diagnostic test (Sickle SCAN\u00ae) or, if\nnot available, Emmel test.\nFull blood count (FBC) if available to guide diagnosis.\nTable 1 - Possible diagnoses with FBC\nPage 45 / 409\nCharacteristics Main diagnoses\nMacrocytic Deficiency (folic acid, vitamin B ), chronic alcoholism\n12\nMicrocytic Iron deficiency (malnutrition, chronic haemorrhage), chronic inflammation (HIV\ninfection, cancer), thalassaemia\nNormocytic Acute haemorrhage, renal failure, haemolysis\nReduced number of Deficiency (iron, folic acid, vitamin B ), spinal tumour, renal failure\n12\nreticulocytes\nIncreased or normal number of Haemolysis, sickle cell disease, thalassaemia\nreticulocytes\nEosinophilia Ancylostomiasis, trichuriasis, schistosomiasis, HIV infection, malignant\nhaemopathies\nAetiological treatment\nAnaemia in itself is not an indication for transfusion.

If prolonged, dehydration can\ncompromise organ perfusion, resulting in shock.\nIt is principally caused by diarrhoea, vomiting and severe burns.\nChildren are particularly susceptible to dehydration due to frequent episodes of gastroenteritis, high surface area to\nvolume ratio and inability to fully communicate, or independently meet their fluid needs.\nThe protocols below are focused on treatment of dehydration caused by diarrhoea and vomiting. Alternative treatment\nprotocols should be used for children with malnutrition (see Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter 1) or in patients with\nsevere burns (see Burns, Chapter 10).\nClinical features and assessment\nHistory of diarrhoea and/or vomiting and concomitant reduced urine output.\nClinical features depend on the degree of dehydration (see table below). Features such as dry mouth, absence of\ntears may also be noted.\nPatients with severe dehydration should be assessed for shock (tachycardia, low blood pressure and delayed\ncapillary refill time etc.).\nElectrolyte disorders may cause tachypnoea, muscle cramps or weakness, cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heart rate,\npalpitation), confusion and/or seizures.\nClassification of degree of dehydration (adapted from the WHO) [1] [2]\nSevere dehydration Some dehydration No dehydration\nAt least 2 of the At least 2 No signs of \"severe\"\nfollowing signs: of the following signs: or \"some\" dehydration.\nLethargic or\nMental status Restless or irritable Normal\nunconscious\nRadial pulse Weak or absent Palpable Easily palpable\nEyes (a) Sunken Sunken Normal\nGoes back very slowly Goes back slowly Goes back quickly\nSkin pinch (b)\n(> 2 seconds) (< 2 seconds) (< 1 second)\nDrinks poorly Thirst, No thirst,\nThirst\nor not able to drink drinks quickly drinks normally\n(a) Sunken eyes may be a normal feature in some children. Ask the mother if the child's eyes are the same as usual or if they are\nmore sunken than usual.\n(b) Skin pinch is assessed by pinching the skin of the abdomen between the thumb and forefinger without twisting. In older\npeople this sign is not reliable as normal aging diminishes skin elasticity.\nTreatment of dehydration\nPage 51 / 409\nSevere dehydration\nTreat shock if present (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nIf able to drink, administer oral rehydration solution (ORS) PO whilst obtaining IV access.\naccording to WHO Treatment Plan C, monitoring infusion rate closely:\nInsert peripheral IV line using large caliber catheter (22-24G in children or 18G in adults) or intraosseous needle.\nAdminister Ringer lactate (RL) a\nWHO Treatment Plan C [1] [2]\nAge First, give 30 ml/kg over (c) : Then, give 70 ml/kg over:\nChildren < 1 year 1 hour 5 hours\nChildren \u2265 1 year and adults 30 minutes 2 \u00bd hours\n(c) Repeat once if radial pulse remains weak or absent after first bolus.\nIn case of suspected severe anaemia, measure haemoglobin and treat accordingly (see Anaemia, Chapter 1). b\nAs soon as the patient is able to drink safely (often within 2 hours), provide ORS as the patient tolerates. ORS\ncontains glucose and electrolytes which prevent development of complications.\nMonitor ongoing losses closely. Assess clinical condition and degree of dehydration at regular intervals to ensure\ncontinuation of appropriate treatment.\nIf over the course of treatment the patient:\nremains or becomes lethargic: measure blood glucose level and/or treat hypoglycaemia (see Hypoglycaemia,\nChapter 1).\ndevelops muscle cramps/weakness and abdominal distention: treat for moderate hypokalaemia with 7.5%\npotassium chloride syrup (1 mmol of K+/ml) PO for 2 days:\nChildren under 45 kg: 2 mmol/kg (2 ml/kg) daily (according to weight, the daily dose is divided into 2 or 3 doses)\nChildren 45 kg and over and adults: 30 mmol (30 ml) 3 times daily\nThis treatment should only be given as an inpatient c .\ndevelops peri-orbital or peripheral oedema: reduce the infusion rate to a minimum, auscultate the lungs, re-\nevaluate the stage of dehydration and the necessity of continuing IV rehydration. If IV rehydration is still required,\ncontinue the infusion at a slower rate and observe the patient closely. If IV rehydration is no longer required,\nchange to oral treatment with ORS.\ndevelops dyspnoea, cough and bibasal crepitations are heard on auscultation of the lungs: sit the patient up,\nreduce the infusion rate to a minimum and administer one dose of furosemide IV (1 mg/kg in children; 40 mg in\nadults). Monitor the patient closely over 30 minutes and assess for underlying cardiorespiratory or renal disease.\nOnce the patient is stabilised, reassess the degree of dehydration and the necessity of continuing IV rehydration.\nIf IV rehydration is still required, re-start at half the previous infusion rate and monitor closely. If IV rehydration is\nno longer required, change to oral treatment with ORS.\nSome dehydration\nAdminister ORS according to WHO Treatment Plan B which equates to 75 ml/kg ORS given over 4 hours.\nWHO Treatment Plan B [1] d\nPage 52 / 409\n< 4 4 to 12 to 5 to\nAge 2 to 4 years \u2265 15 years\nmonths 11 months 23 months 14 years\n5 to 8 to 11 to 15.9 16 to 29.9\nWeight < 5 kg \u2265 30 kg\n7.9 kg 10.9 kg kg kg\nQuantity of ORS over 200 to 400 400 to 600 to 800 to 1200 1200 to 2200 to\n4 hours ml 600 ml 800 ml ml 2200 ml 4000 ml\nEncourage additional age-appropriate fluid intake, including breastfeeding in young children.

It\nis a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children globally.\nThe protocols below are focused on the diagnosis and management of SAM in children 6 to 59 months only. For\nfurther details regarding this age group, and guidance for other age groups, refer to national recommendations and/or\nspecialised protocols.\nClinical assessment\nCharacteristic physical signs\nIn marasmus: skeletal appearance resulting from significant loss of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat.\nIn kwashiorkor:\nBilateral oedema of the lower limbs sometimes extending to other parts of the body (e.g. arms and hands, face).\nDiscoloured, brittle hair; shiny skin which may crack, weep, and become infected.\nDiagnostic and admission criteria\nDiagnostic criteria for SAM are both anthropometric and clinical:\nMid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) a measures the degree of muscle wasting. MUAC < 115 mm indicates\nSAM and significant mortality risk.\nWeight-for-height z-score (WHZ) indicates the degree of weight loss by comparing the weight of the child with the\nmedian weight of non-malnourished children of the same height and sex. SAM is defined as WHZ < \u20133 with\nreference to the WHO Child Growth Standards b .\nThe presence of bilateral pitting oedema of the lower limbs (when other causes of oedema have been ruled out)\nindicates SAM, regardless of MUAC and WHZ.\nAdmission criteria for SAM treatment programmes vary with context. Refer to national recommendations.\nMedical complications\nChildren with any of the following severe medical conditions should receive hospital-based medical management:\nPitting oedema extending from the lower limbs up to the face;\nAnorexia (observed during appetite test);\nOther severe complications: persistent vomiting, shock, altered mental status, seizures, severe anaemia\n(clinically suspected or confirmed), persistent hypoglycaemia, eye lesions due to vitamin A deficiency, frequent\nor abundant diarrhoea, dysentery, dehydration, severe malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, severe cutaneous\ninfection, fever of unknown origin, etc.\nIn the absence of these conditions, children should be treated as outpatients with regular follow-up.\nNutritional treatment\nAll children with SAM should receive nutritional treatment.\nPage 55 / 409\nNutritional treatment is based on the use of specialised nutritious foods enriched with vitamins and minerals: F-75\nand F-100 therapeutic milks, and ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF).\nNutritional treatment is organised into phases:\nPhase 1 (inpatient) intends to restore metabolic functions and treat or stabilize medical complications. Children\nreceive F-75 therapeutic milk. This phase may last 1 to 7 days, after which children usually enter transition\nphase. Children with medical complications generally begin with phase 1.\nTransition phase (inpatient) intends to ensure tolerance of increased food intake and continued improvement of\nclinical condition. Children receive F-100 therapeutic milk and/or RUTF. This phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days, after\nwhich children enter phase 2.\nPhase 2 (outpatient or inpatient) intends to promote rapid weight gain and catch-up growth. Children receive\nRUTF. This phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days when inpatient, after which children are discharged for outpatient\ncare. Children without medical complications enter directly into this phase as outpatients. The outpatient\ncomponent usually lasts several weeks.\nBreastfeeding should be continued in breastfed children.\nDrinking water should be given in addition to meals, especially if the ambient temperature is high, or the child has a\nfever or is receiving RUTF.\nRoutine medical management\nThe following should be provided to all inpatients and outpatients with SAM:\nAntibiotic From D1, unless specific signs of infection are present:\ntreatment amoxicillin PO: 50 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily for 5 to 7 days\nMalaria On D1, rapid diagnostic test in endemic areas and treatment for malaria according to results or if\ntesting is not available (see Malaria, Chapter 6).\nIntestinal In transition phase or upon outpatient admission, albendazole PO:\nparasites Children 12 to 23 months: 200 mg single dose\nChildren 24 months and over: 400 mg single dose\nVaccination In transition phase or upon outpatient admission, measles vaccine for children 6 months to 5\nyears, unless a document shows that the child received 2 doses of vaccine administered as\nfollows: one dose at or after 9 months and one dose at least 4 weeks after the first dose.\nChildren vaccinated between 6 and 8 months should be re-vaccinated as above (i.e. with 2\ndoses) once they reach 9 months of age, provided that an interval of 4 weeks from the first dose\nis respected.\nOther vaccines included in the EPI: check vaccination status and refer the child to vaccination\nservices at discharge.\nTuberculosis At D1 then regularly during treatment, screen for TB. For a child screening positive, perform\n(TB) complete diagnostic evaluation.\nFor more information, refer to the guide Tuberculosis, MSF.\nHIV infection Perform HIV counselling and testing (unless the mother explicitly declines testing).\nChildren under 18 months: test the mother with rapid diagnostic tests. For a mother testing\npositive, request PCR test for the child.\nChildren 18 months and over: test the child with rapid diagnostic tests.\nPage 56 / 409\nManagement of complications\nInfections\nRespiratory, cutaneous and urinary infections are common. However, classic signs of infection, such as fever, may\nbe absent [1] .\nSevere infection or sepsis should be suspected in children that are lethargic or apathetic or suffering from an acute\ncomplication such as hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, seizures, difficulty breathing, or shock. Immediately\nadminister ampicillin IV 50 mg/kg every 8 hours + gentamicin IV 7.5 mg/kg once daily. Continue this treatment\nunless the source of infection is identified and different antibiotic treatment is required.\nIf circulatory impairment or shock, immediately administer ceftriaxone IV, one dose of 80 mg/kg, then assess the\nsource of infection to determine further antibiotic treatment. See also Shock, Chapter 1. Transfuse urgently as for\nsevere anaemia (see below) if haemoglobin (Hb) is < 6 g/dl.\nIn less severe infections, assess the source of infection (see Fever, Chapter 1) and treat accordingly.\nIf fever is present and causes discomfort, undress the child. If insufficient, administer paracetamol PO in low dose:\n10 mg/kg, up to 3 times maximum per 24 hours. Encourage oral fluids (including breast milk).\nIf hypothermia is present, place the child skin-to-skin against the mother's body and cover with a warm blanket.\nTreat for infection as above. Check blood glucose level and treat for hypoglycaemia if necessary (see\nHypoglycaemia, Chapter 1).\nIn children with kwashiorkor, infection of cutaneous lesions is common and may progress to soft tissue or systemic\ninfection. If cutaneous infection is present, stop amoxicillin and start amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO. Use\nformulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days.\nSevere anaemia\nChildren with Hb < 4 or < 6 with signs of decompensation (such as respiratory distress) or ongoing blood loss require\ntransfusion within the first 24 hours. See Anaemia (Chapter 1) for volume to be transfused and patient monitoring\nduring and after transfusion.\nPreferably use packed red blood cells (PRBC), if available. Monitor closely for signs of fluid overload (see box\nbelow).\nDiarrhoea and dehydration\nDiarrhoea is common. Therapeutic foods facilitate the recovery of physiological function of the gastrointestinal\ntract. Amoxicillin administered as part of routine treatment reduces intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Diarrhoea\ngenerally resolves without additional treatment. If an aetiological treatment is necessary, see Acute diarrhoea,\nChapter 3.\nZinc supplementation is not needed if children consume recommended amounts of therapeutic foods.\nThe diagnosis of dehydration is based on history and clinical features.\nClinical assessment is difficult in children with SAM as delayed skin pinch test and sunken eyes are often present\neven in the absence of dehydration.\nFor classification of degree of dehydration adapted for children with SAM, see table below:\nPage 57 / 409\nClinical features No Some Severe\n(2 or more of the following signs) dehydration dehydration dehydration\nLethargic or\nMental status Normal Restless, irritability\nunconscious\nNo thirst, drinks Unable to drink or drinks\nThirst Thirsty, drinks eagerly\nnormally poorly\nAbsent for\nUrine output Normal Reduced\nseveral hours\nRecent frequent watery\nYes Yes Yes\ndiarrhoea and/or vomiting\nRecent obvious rapid weight\nNo Yes Yes\nloss\nAcute diarrhoea with no dehydration (Plan A SAM)\nStools are neither frequent nor abundant (outpatient): oral rehydration solution (ORS) PO: 5 ml/kg after each loose\nstool to prevent dehydration.\nStools are frequent and/or abundant (inpatient): ReSoMal c PO or by nasogastric tube (NGT): 5 ml/kg after each\nloose stool to prevent dehydration.\nIn all cases, continue feeding and breastfeeding, encourage oral fluids.\nAcute diarrhoea with some dehydration (Plan B SAM)\nDetermine the target weight (weight before the onset of diarrhoea) before starting rehydration. If not feasible (e.g.\nnew admission), estimate target weight as current weight x 1.06.\nReSoMal c PO or by NGT: 20 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. In addition, administer 5 ml/kg of ReSoMal after each loose\nstool if tolerated.\nAssess after 2 hours (clinical evaluation and weight):\nIf improvement (diarrhoea and signs of dehydration regress):\nReduce ReSoMal to 10 ml/kg/hour until the signs of dehydration and/or weight loss (known or estimated)\nhave been corrected.\nAssess every 2 hours.\nOnce there are no signs of dehydration and/or the target weight is reached, change to Plan A SAM to\nprevent dehydration.\nIf no improvement after 2 to 4 hours or if oral rehydration cannot compensate for losses: change to Plan C SAM\n\"with circulatory impairment\".\nContinue feeding including breastfeeding.\nMonitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below). Regardless of the target weight, stop rehydration if signs\nof fluid overload appear.\nAcute diarrhoea with severe dehydration (Plan C SAM)\nIn all patients:\nAssess for circulatory impairment (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nEstimate target weight as current weight x 1.1.\nPage 58 / 409\nMeasure blood glucose level and treat hypoglycaemia (Chapter 1) if necessary.\nMonitor vital signs and signs of dehydration every 15 to 30 minutes.\nMonitor urine output.\nMonitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below).\nIf there is no circulatory impairment:\nReSoMal PO or by NGT: 20 ml/kg over 1 hour\nIf the child is alert, continue feeding including breastfeeding.\nAssess after 1 hour:\nIf improvement: change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight.\nIf rehydration PO/NGT not tolerated (e. g. vomiting):\nStop ReSoMal. Administer glucose 5%-Ringer lactate (G5%-RL) d IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours.\nAssess after 2 hours of IV fluids:\nIf improvement and/or not vomiting, stop G5%-RL IV infusion and change to Plan B SAM.\nIf no improvement or still vomiting, continue G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours.\nIf deterioration with circulatory impairment: see below.\nIf there is circulatory impairment:\nAdminister ceftriaxone IV, one dose of 80 mg/kg. Subsequent antibiotic treatment depends on assessment of\nunderlying cause.\nAdminister G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. Stop ReSoMal if the child was taking it.\nAssess after 1 hour of IV fluids:\nIf improvement and no vomiting: stop IV fluid and change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight.\nIf no improvement:\nContinue G5%-RL IV infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour.\nPrepare for blood transfusion.\nAssess after 2 hours of IV fluids:\nIf improvement: change to Plan B SAM, but keep the same target weight.\nIf no improvement or deterioration:\nCheck Hb as baseline and administer blood transfusion using a separate IV line. See Anaemia (Chapter 1)\nfor volume to be transfused and patient monitoring during and after transfusion.\nWhile transfusing, continue G5%-RL IV infusion 10 ml/kg/hour for another 2 hours.\nSigns of fluid overload include:\nRR \u2265 10 breaths/minute compared to initial RR, or\nHR \u2265 20 beats/minute compared to initial HR\nPlus any one of the following:\nNew or worsening hypoxia (decrease in SpO by > 5%)\n2\nNew onset of rales and/or fine crackles in lung fields\nNew galloping heart rhythm\nIncreased liver size (must have marked liver border with pen before rehydration)\nNew peripheral or eyelid oedema\nOther complications\nFor other complications (to be treated as inpatient), see:\nHypoglycaemia, seizures, Chapter 1.\nAcute pneumonia, Chapter 2.\nStomatitis, Chapter 3.\nXerophthalmia (vitamin A deficiency), Chapter 5.\nPage 59 / 409\nDischarge criteria\nIn general:\nChildren can be discharged from hospital and be treated as outpatients if the following criteria are met:\nclinically well;\nmedical complications controlled;\nable to eat RUTF (observed during appetite test);\nreduction or absence of oedema;\ncaregiver feels able to provide care as outpatient;\nvaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised.\nChildren can be discharged from nutritional treatment if the following criteria are met:\nco-existing medical conditions stable and outpatient treatment organised if necessary (e.g. dressing changes,\nfollow-up for chronic diseases);\nvaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised;\nabsence of oedema and WHZ > \u20132 or MUAC > 125 mm for at least 2 weeks.\nDischarge criteria vary with context. Refer to national recommendations.\nFootnotes\n(a) MUAC is measured at the mid-point of the left upper arm. The arm should be relaxed. The measuring tape should be in\ncontact with the skin all around the arm, without exerting pressure.\n(b) For WHZ, see WHO simplified field tables in z-scores for girls and for boys:\nhttps://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/standards/weight-for-length-height\n(c) ReSoMal is a specific oral rehydration solution for malnourished children, containing less sodium and more potassium than\nstandard ORS.

Conscience is\ninitially maintained.\nPerform maneuvers to relieve obstruction only if the patient cannot speak or cough or emit any sound:\nChildren over 1 year and adults:\nHeimlich manoeuvre: stand behind the patient. Place a closed fist in the pit of the stomach, above the navel and\nbelow the ribs. Place the other hand over fist and press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust. Perform\none to five abdominal thrusts in order to compress the lungs from the below and dislodge the foreign body.\nChildren under 1 year:\nPlace the infant face down across the forearm (resting the forearm on the leg) and support the infant\u2019s head with\nthe hand. With the heel of the other hand, perform one to five slaps on the back, between shoulder plates.\nIf unsuccessful, turn the infant on their back. Perform five forceful sternal compressions as in cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation: use 2 or 3 fingers in the center of the chest just below the nipples. Press down approximately one-\nthird the depth of the chest (about 3 to 4 cm).\nRepeat until the foreign body is expelled and the patient resumes spontaneous breathing (coughing, crying, talking). If\nthe patient loses consciousness ventilate and perform cardiopulmonary rescucitation.

However, they may be an early sign of another infection (e.g.\nmeasles or influenza) or may be complicated by a bacterial infection (e.g. otitis media or sinusitis).\nClinical features\nNasal discharge or obstruction, which may be accompanied by sore throat, fever, cough, lacrimation, and diarrhoea\nin infants. Purulent nasal discharge is not indicative of a secondary bacterial infection.\nIn children under 5 years, routinely check the tympanic membranes to look for an associated otitis media.\nTreatment\nAntibiotherapy is not recommended: it does not promote recovery nor prevent complications.\nTreatment is symptomatic:\nClear the nose with 0.9% sodium chloride a .\nFever, throat soreness: paracetamol PO for 2 to 3 days (Fever, Chapter 1).\nFootnotes\n(a) For a child: place him on his back, head turned to the side, and instil 0.9% sodium chloride into each nostril.\nPage 65 / 409\nAcute sinusitis\nAcute sinusitis is an inflammation of one or more of the sinus cavities, caused by an infection or allergy.\nMost acute sinus infections are viral and resolve spontaneously in less than 10 days. Treatment is symptomatic.\nAcute bacterial sinusitis may be a primary infection, a complication of viral sinusitis or of dental origin. The principal\ncausative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.\nIt is essential to distinguish between bacterial sinusitis and common rhinopharyngitis (see Rhinitis and rhinopharyngitis).\nAntibiotic therapy is required in case of bacterial sinusitis only.\nWithout treatment, severe sinusitis in children may cause serious complications due to the spread of infection to the\nneighbouring bony structures, orbits or the meninges.\nClinical features\nSinusitis in adults\nPurulent unilateral or bilateral discharge, nasal obstruction\nand\nFacial unilateral or bilateral pain that increases when bending over; painful pressure in maxillary area or behind the\nforehead.\nFever is usually mild or absent.\nSinusitis is likely if symptoms persist for longer than 10 to 14 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days or are severe (severe\npain, high fever, deterioration of the general condition).\nSinusitis in children\nSame symptoms; in addition, irritability or lethargy or cough or vomiting may be present.\nIn the event of severe infection: deterioration of the general condition, fever over 39 \u00b0C, periorbital or facial\noedema.\nTreatment\nSymptomatic treatment\nFever and pain (Chapter 1).\nClear the nose with 0.9% sodium chloride a .\nAntibiotherapy\nIn adults:\nAntibiotherapy is indicated if the patient meets the criteria of duration or severity of symptoms.

The majority of cases are of viral origin and do not require antibiotic\ntreatment. Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the main bacterial cause, and mainly affects children aged 3 to 14 years.\nAcute rheumatic fever (ARF), a serious late complication of GAS pharyngitis, can be prevented with antibiotic\ntreatment.\nOne of the main objectives of assessing acute pharyngitis is to identify patients requiring antibiotic treatment.\nClinical features\nFeatures common to all types of pharyngitis: throat pain, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), inflammation of the\ntonsils and pharynx, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, with or without fever.\nSpecific features, depending on the cause:\nCommon forms:\nErythematous (red throat) or exudative (red throat and whitish exudate) pharyngitis: this appearance is\ncommon to both viral and GAS pharyngitis. Centor criteria help assessment and decrease the empirical use of\nantibiotics in settings where rapid testing for GAS is not available. A Centor score of less than 2 rules out GAS\ninfection [1] [2] . Nevertheless, in patients with risk factors (immunosuppression, personal or family history of ARF)\nfor poststreptococcal complications, or for local or general complications, do not use Centor score and\nprescribe empirical antibiotic treatment.\nCentor criteria\nCriteria Score\nTemperature > 38 \u00b0C 1\nAbsence of cough 1\nTender anterior cervical lymph node(s) 1\nTonsillar swelling or exudate 1\nIn patients over 14 years, the probability of GAS pharyngitis is low. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to the\nEpstein-Barr virus should be suspected in adolescents and young adults with extreme fatigue, generalized\nadenopathy and often splenomegaly.\nErythematous or exudative pharyngitis may also be associated with gonococcal or primary HIV infection. In\nthese cases, the diagnosis is mainly prompted by the patient's history.\nPseudomembranous pharyngitis (red tonsils/pharynx covered with an adherent greyish white false membrane):\nsee Diphtheria, Chapter 2.\nVesicular pharyngitis (clusters of tiny blisters or ulcers on the tonsils): always viral (coxsackie virus or primary\nherpetic infection).\nUlcero-necrotic pharyngitis: hard and painless syphilitic chancre of the tonsil; tonsillar ulcer soft on palpation in\na patient with poor oral hygiene and malodorous breath (Vincent tonsillitis).\nOther forms of pharyngitis:\nPage 68 / 409\nSpots on oral mucosa (Koplik\u2019s spots) accompanied by conjunctivitis and skin rash (see Measles, Chapter 8).\n\u201cStrawberry\u201d (red and bumpy) tongue accompanied by a skin rash: scarlet fever caused by GAS.\nLocal complications:\nPeritonsillar, retropharyngeal or lateral pharyngeal abscess: fever, intense pain, dysphagia, hoarse voice, trismus\n(limitation of mouth opening), unilateral deviation of the uvula.\nGeneral complications:\nComplications due to the toxin: diphtheria (see Diphtheria, Chapter 2).\nPoststreptococcal complications: ARF, acute glomerulonephritis.\nSigns of serious illness in children: severe dehydration, severe difficulty swallowing, upper airway compromise,\ndeterioration of general condition.\nDifferential diagnosis: epiglottitis (see Epiglottitis, Chapter 2).\nTreatment\nSymptomatic treatment (fever and pain): paracetamol or ibuprofen PO (Fever, Chapter 1).\nCentor score \u2264 1: viral pharyngitis, which typically resolves within a few days (or weeks, for IM): no antibiotic\ntreatment.\nCentor score \u2265 2 or scarlet fever: antibiotic treatment for GAS infections [3] :\nIf single-use injection equipment is available, benzathine benzylpenicillin is the drug of choice as streptococcus\nA resistance to penicillin remains rare; it is the only antibiotic proven effective in reducing the incidence of\nrheumatic fever; and the treatment is administered as a single dose.\nbenzathine benzylpenicillin IM\nChildren under 30 kg (or under 10 years): 600 000 IU single dose\nChildren 30 kg and over (or 10 years and over) and adults: 1.2 MIU single dose\nPenicillin V is the oral reference treatment, but poor adherence is predictable due to the length of treatment.\nphenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) PO for 10 days\nChildren 1 to < 6 years: 250 mg 2 times daily\nChildren 6 to < 12 years: 500 mg 2 times daily\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily\nChildren under 1 year: 125 mg 2 times daily\nAmoxicillin is an alternative and the treatment has the advantage of being relatively short.

The bacteria secretes a toxin which causes severe local as well as systemic effects. Death\ncan occur from airway obstruction or as a result of systemic complications, including damage to the myocardium and\nnervous system, caused by the toxin.\nCases can remain infectious up to 8 weeks after initial infection [2] . Antibiotic treatment can reduce infectiousness to 6\ndays [3] .\nVaccination is the key to prevention and control of diphtheria. It protects individuals from severe disease (fewer and\nless severe symptoms) but does not prevent the spread of C. diphtheriae. Clinical disease does not confer protective\nimmunity and vaccination is an integral part of case management.\nClinical features\nDuring clinical examination respect standard, contact, and droplet precautions (handwashing, gloves, gown, mask,\netc.). Conduct a careful examination of the throat.\nSigns of respiratory diphtheria a :\npharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, tonsillitis or laryngitis with tough, greyish, firmly adherent pseudo-membranes of the\npharynx, nasopharynx, tonsils, or larynx;\ndysphagia and cervical adenitis, at times progressing to massive swelling of the neck;\nairway obstruction and possible suffocation when the infection extends to the nasal passages, larynx, trachea\nand bronchi;\nfever is generally low-grade [2] .\nGeneralised signs due to effects of the toxin:\ncardiac dysfunction (tachycardia, arrhythmias), severe myocarditis with heart failure and possibly cardiogenic\nshock (see Shock, Chapter 1) 3 to 7 days or 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease;\nneuropathies in 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of disease leading to nasal voice and difficulty with swallowing\n(paralysis of the soft palate), vision (ocular motor paralysis), breathing (paralysis of respiratory muscles) and\nambulation (limb paralysis);\noliguria, anuria and acute renal failure.\nDifferential diagnoses: Epiglottitis and Acute pharyngitis, Chapter 2, Stomatitis, Chapter 3.\nLaboratory\nDiagnosis is confirmed by isolation of toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture (and antibiotic susceptibility test) of swab\nspecimens collected from the affected areas: throat (tonsils, pharyngeal mucosa, soft palate, exudate, ulcer, etc.),\nnasopharynx.\nThe presence of the toxin is confirmed by PCR testing (detection of diphtheria toxin gene).\nTreatment\nIsolation of patients; standard, droplet, and contact precautions for medical staff.\nPage 71 / 409\nDiphtheria antitoxin (DAT) b derived from horse serum:\nAdminister DAT as soon as possible after disease onset. Do not wait for bacteriological confirmation [1] ; administer\nDAT under close monitoring in a hospital setting, according to the Besredka method to assess possibility of allergy.\nAny delay can diminish efficacy.\nThere is a risk of anaphylactic reaction, especially in patients with asthma. Close monitoring of the patient is\nessential, with immediate availability of equipment for manual ventilation (Ambu bag, face mask) and\nintubation, Ringer lactate and epinephrine (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nBesredka method: inject 0.1 ml SC and wait 15 minutes. If there is no allergic reaction (no erythema at the injection\nsite or a flat erythema of less than 0.5 cm in diameter), inject a further 0.25 ml SC. If there is no reaction after 15\nminutes, inject the rest of the product IM or IV depending on the volume to be administered.\nDoses are given as a function of the severity of illness, and the delay in treatment:\nClinical signs Dose in units Administration route\nLaryngitis or pharyngitis\n20 to 40 000\nor duration < 48 hours\nIM or IV infusion in 250 ml of 0.9% sodium\nRhinopharyngitis 40 to 60 000\nchloride in 2 to 4 hours for doses of more\nthan 20 000 units.\nSevere disease (respiratory distress,\nshock), cervical oedema or duration \u2265 48 80 to 100 000\nhours\nAntibiotic treatment (as soon as possible without waiting for bacteriological confirmation ) for 14 days or according\nto length of treatment recommended by the national protocol:\nif the patient can swallow:\nazithromycin PO (first-line)\nChildren: 10 to 12 mg/kg once daily (max. 500 mg daily)\nAdults: 500 mg once daily\nor\nerythromycin PO\nChildren under 40 kg: 10 to 15 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) 4 times daily\nChildren 40 kg and over and adults: 500 mg 4 times daily\nor\nphenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) PO\nChildren under 40 kg: 10 to 15 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) 4 times daily\nChildren 40 kg and over and adults: 500 mg 4 times daily\nIf the patient cannot swallow, start with one of the treatments below and change as soon as possible to oral\nroute with one of the oral treatments above to complete 14 days of treatment:\nprocaine benzylpenicillin IM\nChildren under 25 kg: 50 000 IU/kg (= 50 mg/kg) once daily (max. 1.2 MIU = 1.2 g daily)\nChildren 25 kg and over and adults: 1.2 MIU (= 1.2 g) once daily\nNever administer procaine benzylpenicillin by IV injection or infusion.\nIn penicillin-allergic patients, use erythromycin IV c .\nIntubation/tracheotomy if necessary (airway obstruction, respiratory failure, etc.).\nIf the event of shock, see Shock, Chapter 1, for complementary treatment.\nUpdate every patient's vaccination status before hospital discharge (or during first visit, if receiving home-based\ncare). If the patient has been administered DAT and can receive adequate home-based follow up after hospital\ndischarge, wait 3 weeks after administration of DAT before vaccination.\nPage 72 / 409\nManagement of close contacts\nClose contacts include household members living under the same roof and people who were directly exposed (less than\none metre) to nasopharyngeal secretions of the patient on a regular basis (e.g. family or close friends, children in the\nsame class, medical personnel) during the 5 days or nights prior to onset of symptoms of the case [4] .\nCollect nasal and pharyngeal swabs for culture before starting antibiotic prophylaxis; temperature and throat\nexamination daily (10 days); exclusion from school or work until 48 hours after starting antibiotic prophylaxis.

Common precipitants of otitis\nexterna are maceration, trauma of the ear canal or presence of a foreign body or dermatologic diseases (such as\neczema, psoriasis).\nClinical features\nEar canal pruritus or ear pain, often severe and exacerbated by motion of the pinna; feeling of fullness in the ear;\nclear or purulent ear discharge or no discharge\nOtoscopy (remove skin debris and secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud\nor a small piece of dry cotton wool):\ndiffuse erythema and edema, or infected eczema, of the ear canal\nlook for a foreign body\nif visible, the tympanic membrane is normal (swelling and pain very often prevent adequate visualization of the\ntympanic membrane)\nTreatment\nRemove a foreign body, if present.\nTreatment of pain: paracetamol PO (Chapter 1, Pain).\nLocal treatment:\nRemove secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry\ncotton wool). Consider ear irrigation (0.9% sodium chloride, using a syringe) only if the tympanic membrane can\nbe fully visualised and is intact (no perforation). Otherwise, ear irrigation is contra-indicated.\nApply ciprofloxacin ear drops in the affected ear(s) for 7 days:\nChildren \u2265 1 year: 3 drops 2 times daily\nAdults: 4 drops 2 times daily\nPage 81 / 409\nAcute otitis media (AOM)\nAcute inflammation of the middle ear, due to viral or bacterial infection, very common in children under 3 years, but\nuncommon in adults.\nThe principal causative organisms of bacterial otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,\nMoraxella catarrhalis and in older children, Streptococcus pyogenes.\nClinical features\nRapid onset of ear pain (in infants: crying, irritability, sleeplessness, reluctance to nurse) and ear discharge\n(otorrhoea) or fever.\nOther signs such as rhinorrhoea, cough, diarrhoea or vomiting are frequently associated, and may confuse the\ndiagnosis, hence the necessity of examining the tympanic membranes.\nOtoscopy: bright red tympanic membrane (or yellowish if rupture is imminent) and presence of pus, either\nexternalised (drainage in ear canal if the tympanic membrane is ruptured) or internalised (opaque or bulging tympanic\nmembrane). The combination of these signs with ear pain or fever confirms the diagnosis of AOM.\nNote:\nThe following otoscopic findings are not sufficient to make the diagnosis of AOM:\nA red tympanic membrane alone, with no evidence of bulging or perforation, is suggestive of viral otitis in a\ncontext of upper respiratory tract infection, or may be due to prolonged crying in children or high fever.\nThe presence of air bubbles or fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane, in the absence of signs and symptoms\nof acute infection, is suggestive of otitis media with effusion (OME).\nComplications, particularly in high-risk children (malnutrition, immunodeficiency, ear malformation) include chronic\nsuppurative otitis media, and rarely, mastoiditis, brain abscess or meningitis.\nTreatment\nIn all cases:\nTreatment of fever and pain: paracetamol PO (Chapter 1).\nEar irrigation is contra-indicated if the tympanic membrane is ruptured, or when the tympanic membrane cannot\nbe fully visualised. Ear drops are not indicated.\nIndications for antibiotic therapy:\nAntibiotics are prescribed in children less than 2 years, children whose assessment suggests severe infection\n(vomiting, fever > 39 \u00b0C, severe pain) and children at risk of unfavourable outcome (malnutrition,\nimmunodeficiency, ear malformation).\nFor other children:\nIf the child can be re-examined within 48 to 72 hours: it is preferable to delay antibiotic prescription.\nSpontaneous resolution is probable and a short symptomatic treatment of fever and pain may be sufficient.\nAntibiotics are prescribed if there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms after 48 to 72 hours.\nIf the child cannot be re-examined: antibiotics are prescribed.\nFor children treated with antibiotics: advise the mother to bring the child back if fever and pain persist after 48\nhours.\nChoice of antibiotherapy:\nAmoxicillin is the first-line treatment:\namoxicillin PO for 5 days\nChildren: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily)\nAdults: 1 g 3 times daily\nPage 82 / 409\nAmoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used as second-line treatment, in the case of treatment failure. Treatment failure is\ndefined as persistence of fever and/or ear pain after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment.\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO for 5 days\nUse formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. The dose is expressed in amoxicillin:\nChildren < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nChildren \u2265 40 kg and adult:\nRatio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily)\nRatio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily)\nPersistence of a ear drainage alone, without fever and pain, in a child who has otherwise improved (reduction in\nsystemic symptoms and local inflammation) does not warrant a change in antibiotic therapy. Clean ear canal by\ngentle dry mopping until no more drainage is obtained.\nMacrolides should be reserved for very rare penicillin-allergic patients, as treatment failure (resistance to\nmacrolides) is frequent.\nazithromycin PO\nChildren over 6 months: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days\nPage 83 / 409\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)\nChronic bacterial infection of the middle ear with persistent purulent discharge through a perforated tympanic\nmembrane.\nThe principal causative organisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, staphylococcus, other Gram negative\nand anaerobic bacteria.\nClinical features\nPurulent discharge for more than 2 weeks, often associated with hearing loss or even deafness; absence of pain\nand fever\nOtoscopy: perforation of the tympanic membrane and purulent exudate\nComplications:\nConsider a superinfection (AOM) in the case of new onset of fever with ear pain, and treat accordingly.\nConsider mastoiditis in the case of new onset of high fever, severe ear pain and/or tender swelling behind the\near, in a patient who appears significantly unwell.\nConsider brain abscess or meningitis in the case of impaired consciousness, neck stiffness and focal\nneurological signs (e.g. facial nerve paralysis).\nTreatment\nRemove secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry\ncotton wool).\nApply ciprofloxacin ear drops until no more drainage is obtained (approximately 2 weeks, max. 4 weeks):\nChildren 1 year and over: 3 drops 2 times daily\nAdults: 4 drops 2 times daily\nComplications:\nChronic mastoiditis is a medical emergency that requires prompt hospitalisation, prolonged antibiotherapy that\ncovers the causative organisms of CSOM (ceftriaxone IM for 10 days + ciprofloxacin PO for 14 days),\natraumatic cleaning of the ear canal; surgical treatment may be required. Before transfer to hospital, if the\npatient needs to be transferred, administer the first dose of antibiotics.\nMeningitis (Chapter 7).\nPage 84 / 409\nPertussis (whooping cough)\nLast updated: December 2024\nPertussis is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis.\nIt is transmitted via airborne droplets spread by infected people (by coughing and/or sneezing), particularly within 3\nweeks of the onset of cough [1] . Despite the development of effective vaccines, it remains an important cause of\nmorbidity and mortality, particularly in infants.\nThis disease is endemic worldwide and outbreaks are common. It most commonly affects children < 5 years, but can\naffect any age group. Reported incidence in adolescents and adults has been increasing in some regions [2] .\nPertussis is a notifiable disease in many countries, and cases should be reported to local or national public health\nauthorities. Pertussis immunization is part of all vaccination schedules and is included in the Expanded Programme on\nImmunization (EPI).\nClinical features\nAfter an incubation period of 7 to 10 days (up to 21 days), the illness evolves in 3 stages [3] :\nCatarrhal stage (1 to 2 weeks, but may be shorter in infants < 6 months):\nRunny nose, mild cough, no or low-grade fever.\nDuring this stage, the disease is indistinguishable from other non-specific respiratory infections.\nParoxysmal stage (1 to 6 weeks):\nCough of increasing severity, occuring in characteristic bouts (paroxysms) of a series of coughs during one\nexhalation, followed by a laboured inspiration causing a distinctive gasping sound (whoop), and/or post-tussive\nvomiting.\nNo or low-grade fever.\nApnoea and cyanosis (in infants).\nProlonged cough, sometimes without paroxysms or whoop (particularly in older children and adults).\nComplications may include secondary bacterial pneumonia (new-onset fever can be an indicator), dehydration and\nmalnutrition triggered by feeding difficulty due to cough and vomiting, seizures, encephalopathy, sudden death,\nintracranial bleeding, petechiae, rib fracture, hernia, rectal prolapse.\nConvalescent stage (weeks to months):\nParoxysms of cough gradually decrease in frequency and severity.\nThe disease is most severe, with a high risk of death, in infants. Adolescents and adults commonly have milder\nsymptoms, but older adults, immunocompromised persons, and people with underlying respiratory conditions are at risk\nof severe disease and hospitalisation [4] .\nPertussis is most contagious and antibiotic treatment is most beneficial during the catarrhal stage of the illness. Since\nthis is also the period during which clinical symptoms and signs are non-specific, it is necessary to maintain a high index\nof suspicion with clues from the context. These include patients with any compatible symptoms and close contact with\na suspected case or in a pertussis outbreak setting.\nManagement\nSuspected cases\nAntibiotic treatment\nPage 85 / 409\nAntibiotic treatment is indicated for the following patients [5] and should be started as soon as pertussis is suspected:\nAll patients 1 year of age and older, within 3 weeks of the onset of cough.\nInfants and pregnant women, within 6 weeks of the onset of cough.\nFirst line\nazithromycin PO Children < 6 months: 10 mg/kg once daily\nfor 5 days Children \u2265 6 months: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) on D1 then 5 mg/kg (max.\n250 mg) once daily from D2 to D5\nAdults: 500 mg on D1 then 250 mg once daily from D2 to D5\nAlternatives\nerythromycin PO (a) Children: 15 mg/kg 3 times daily\nfor 7 days Adults: 1 g 3 times daily\nco-trimoxazole PO (b) Children \u2265 6 weeks: 20 mg SMX/4 mg TMP/kg (max. 800 mg SMX/160\nfor 14 days mg TMP) 2 times daily\nAdults: 800 mg SMX/160 mg TMP 2 times daily\n(a) Erythromycin is an alternative, but azithromycin is better tolerated and simpler to administer (shorter treatment duration,\nfewer daily doses).\n(b) Use co-trimoxazole only if macrolides are contra-indicated, not tolerated, or not available.\nAvoid:\n- during the first trimester of pregnancy (risk of congenital malformations),\n- after 36 weeks of pregnancy and in women breastfeeding neonates (0 to 4 weeks), or breastfeeding infants that are\npremature, low birth weight, jaundiced, or ill (risk of haemolysis and jaundice in the child).\nAdvise patients to seek immediate medical attention if there are signs of anaemia or jaundice, especially in regions with high\nprevalence of G6PD deficiency.\nAdmit the following patients to hospital\nPatients with severe illness (e.g. respiratory distress, apnoea, cyanosis, pneumonia, seizures or impaired\nconsciousness)\nInfants up to 3 months of age (with monitoring 24 hours per day due to the risk of apnoea)\nPatients with difficulty in feeding or drinking\nInfection prevention and control measures\nPatients with pertussis are considered infectious until they have completed 5 days of appropriate antibiotics, or if not\ntreated, until 21 days after the start of the paroxysmal cough [1] . During this infectious period, these measures should\nbe followed:\nIn hospital: single room if possible, or grouping pertussis cases together away from other patients\n(cohorting); standard precautions and droplet precautions (including, for the patient, cough etiquette and wearing a\nsurgical mask if outside the room) [6]\nAll patients: avoid contact with young children and pregnant women; avoid congregate settings including childcare,\nschool, and work\nPage 86 / 409\nSupportive care\nHydration and nutrition: if child is breastfeeding, continue; ensure adequate fluid and calorie intake, give frequent small\nfeedings including after coughing bouts and post-tussive vomiting; some patients may require nasogastric tube feeding\nor IV maintenance fluids; be aware that NG tube placement might provoke paroxysmal coughing, so it should be\ninserted by experienced medical staff with minimal manipulation. If weight loss occurred during illness, consider food\nsupplements for several weeks during convalescent stage when child is able to eat comfortably.\nRespiratory measures\nPlace the patient in a semi-reclining position (\u00b1 30\u00b0).\nIn case of apnoea, stimulate the patient, but be prepared to ventilate if necessary (keep bag and mask accessible).\nAdminister oxygen if SpO < 92%, for severe respiratory distress, or for recurrent apnoea. Perform gentle\n2\noropharyngeal suctioning if required but avoid deep suctioning (may provoke paroxysmal coughing).\nFor children treated as outpatients, teach the parents about signs that require immediate medical attention (e.g.\nrespiratory difficulty, apnoea, cyanosis, increasing fever, seizures or impaired consciousness, dehydration, feeding\ndifficulty).\nContacts\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (same antibiotic treatment as for suspect cases) is recommended, regardless of\nvaccination status, for:\nAsymptomatic close contacts (having face-to-face exposure or direct contact with oral, nasal, or other\nrespiratory secretions [7] ) of a person with suspected pertussis within 3 weeks of onset of paroxysmal cough\nAsymptomatic exposed people at high risk of complications or who will come into contact with people at high\nrisk [4] [8] :\npregnant women in the third trimester (risk to neonate),\ninfants under 1 year,\npeople with immunodepression, moderate to severe asthma, and consider for people with other underlying\nrespiratory conditions and adults \u2265 65 years.\nIsolation of asymptomatic contacts is not necessary.\nSymptomatic contacts should be treated as suspected pertussis.\nAssess whether the person is up-to-date with pertussis vaccination according to national protocol (see\nPrevention).\nPrevention\nPertussis vaccination provides substantial immunity that wanes over time [1] .\nIn all cases (suspected cases and contacts) who are not up-to-date with pertussis vaccination, begin or refer for\nvaccination.\nRoutine vaccination with a 3-dose primary series of polyvalent vaccine containing pertussis antigen(s) from the age\nof 6 weeks or according to national protocol. A booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year\nof life [1] . Based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be required later in life to reinforce immunity and\nreduce the risk of developing pertussis.\nIf the pertussis primary vaccination series has been interrupted, it should be completed rather than restarted from\nthe beginning.\nIn general, vaccinations are deferred for patients with moderate to severe illness, but the vaccine should be\nadministered as soon as the patient's condition has improved.\nVaccination will probably not prevent disease in a person who is already infected by B. pertussis. It is not a\nsubstitute for post-exposure prophylaxis [7] [9] .\nPage 87 / 409\nReferences\n1. Pertussis vaccines: WHO position paper \u2013 August 2015.

Transmission of RSV is direct,\nthrough inhalation of droplets (coughing, sneezing), and indirect, through contact with hands or materials contaminated\nby infected secretions.\nIn the majority of cases, bronchiolitis is benign, resolves spontaneously (relapses are possible), and can be treated on\nan outpatient basis.\nSevere cases may occur, which put the child at risk due to exhaustion or secondary bacterial infection. Hospitalisation\nis necessary when signs/criteria of severity are present (10 to 20% of cases).\nClinical features\nTachypnoea, dyspnoea, wheezing, cough; profuse, frothy, obstructive secretions.\nOn auscultation: prolonged expiration with diffuse, bilateral wheezes; sometimes diffuse fine, end-inspiratory\ncrackles.\nRhinopharyngitis, with dry cough, precedes these features by 24 to 72 hours; fever is absent or moderate.\nSigns of severity:\nSignificant deterioration in general condition, toxic appearance (pallor, greyish colouration)\nApnoea, cyanosis (check lips, buccal mucosa, fingernails)\nRespiratory distress (nasal flaring, sternal and chest wall indrawing)\nAnxiety and agitation (hypoxia), altered level of consciousness\nRespiratory rate > 60/minute\nDecreased signs of respiratory distress (exhaustion) and decline of respiratory rate (< 30/minute below the age\nof 1 year and < 20/minute below the age of 3 years). Exercise caution in interpreting these signs as indicators of\nclinical improvement.\nSpO persistently < 92%\n2\nSweats, tachycardia at rest and in the absence of fever\nSilence on auscultation (severe bronchospasm)\nDifficulty drinking or sucking (reduced tolerance for exertion)\nTreatment\nTreatment is symptomatic. Obstructive signs and symptoms last for about 10 days; cough may persist for 2 weeks or\nlonger.\nHospitalise children with one of the following criteria:\nPresence of any sign of severity\nPre-existing pathology (cardiac or pulmonary disease, malnutrition, HIV infection, etc.)\nConsider hospitalisation on a case-by-case basis in the following situations:\nAssociated acute pathology (viral gastro-enteritis, bacterial infection, etc.)\nAge less than 3 months\nIn all other cases, the child may be treated at home, provided the parents are taught how to carry out treatment, and\nwhat signs of severity should lead to re-consultation.\nPage 92 / 409\nOutpatient treatment\nNasal irrigation with 0.9% NaCl before each feeding (demonstrate the technique to the mother) a .\nSmall, frequent feedings to reduce vomiting triggered by bouts of coughing.\nIncreased fluids if fever and/or significant secretions are present.\nTreat fever (Chapter 1).\nHandle the patient the patient as little as possible and avoid unnecessary procedures.\nHospitalisation\nIn all cases:\nPlace the infant in a semi-reclining position (\u00b1 30\u00b0).\nNasal irrigation, small, frequent feeds, treatment of fever: as for outpatient treatment.\nGentle oro-pharyngeal suction if needed.\nMonitor fluid intake: normal requirements are 80 to 100 ml/kg/day + 20 to 25 ml/kg/day with high fever or very\nprofuse secretions.\nAccording to symptoms:\nHumidified nasal oxygen if respiratory distress or SpO < 92%.\n2\nWhen there is vomiting or significant fatigue when sucking, fluid requirements may be administered by\nnasogastric tube (small volumes on a frequent basis) or the IV route, for the shortest possible time. Avoid\nbreastfeeding or oral feeds in children with severe tachypnoea, but do not prolong NG feeds (respiratory\ncompromise) or IV infusions any longer than necessary.\nBronchodilator therapy is not indicated but a trial treatment may be given in case of severe respiratory distress\n(salbutamol metered-dose inhaler, 100 micrograms/puff: 2 to 3 puffs with spacer, repeated 2 times at an\ninterval of 30 minutes). If inhaled salbutamol appears effective in relieving symptoms, the treatment is continued\n(2 to 3 puffs every 6 hours in the acute phase, then gradual reduction as recovery takes place). If the trial is\nineffective, the treatment is discontinued.\nAntibiotics are not indicated unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial\npneumonia.\nPrevention and control\nThe risk of transmission of the virus is increased in hospital settings:\nChildren with bronchiolitis should be grouped together, away from other children (cohorting).\nAs infection is most commonly transmitted by the hands, the most important prevention measure is hand-washing\nafter any contact with patients, and objects or surfaces in contact with patients on which the virus may survive for\nseveral hours.\nIn addition, staff should wear gowns, gloves and surgical masks when in contact with patients.\nFootnotes\n(a) Lie the child on his back, head turned to the side and instil 0.9% NaCl into the nose, one nostril at a time.\nPage 93 / 409\nAcute pneumonia\nPneumonia in children under 5 years of age\nPneumonia in children over 5 years and adults\nPersistent pneumonia\nAcute pneumonia is a viral, bacterial (pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, atypical bacteria) or\nparasitic (pneumocystosis) infection of the pulmonary alveoli.\nPage 94 / 409\nPneumonia in children under 5 years of age\nThe most common causes are viruses, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae.\nClinical features\nCough or difficulty breathing\nFever often high (> 39 \u00b0C), but the child may present with low-grade fever or may have no fever (often a sign of\nserious illness)\nClinical examination must be done on a calm child in order to correctly count the respiratory rate and look for signs of\nseverity.\nA child has tachypnoea (increased respiratory rate) if:\nRR \u2265 60 breaths/minute in children under 1 months\nRR \u2265 50 breaths/minute in children from 1 to 11 months\nRR \u2265 40 breaths/minute in children from 12 months to 5 years\nOn pulmonary auscultation: dullness with diminished vesicular breath sounds, crepitations and sometimes bronchial\nbreathing or normal pulmonary auscultation.\nSigns of severity (severe pneumonia):\nChest indrawing: the inferior thoracic wall depresses on inspiration as the superior abdomen expands\nCyanosis (lips, oral mucosa, fingernails) or SpO < 90%\n2\nNasal flaring\nAltered consciousness (child is abnormally sleepy or difficult to wake)\nStridor (hoarse noise on inspiration)\nGrunting (a short repetitive noise produced by a partial closure of the vocal cords) on expiration\nRefusal to drink or feed\nChildren under 2 months\nSevere malnutrition\nNotes:\nIn malnourished children, the RR thresholds should be decreased by 5 breaths/minute from those listed above.\nChest indrawing is significant if it is clearly visible and present at all times. If it is observed when a child is upset or\nfeeding and is not visible when the child is resting, there is no chest indrawing.\nIn children under 2 months of age, moderate chest indrawing is normal as the thoracic wall is flexible.\nIf only the soft tissues between the ribs or above the clavicles depress, there is no chest indrawing.\nConsider also:\nMalaria in endemic areas, as it may also cause cough and tachypnoea.\nStaphylococcal pneumonia in patients with empyema or painful abdominal swelling and diarrhoea.\nPneumocystosis in children with confirmed or suspected HIV infection (see HIV infection and AIDS, Chapter 8).\nTuberculosis:\nin a child with cough, fever and poor weight gain and a history of close contact with a tuberculous patient a .

These episodes are usually associated\nwith airflow obstruction within the lung, often reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment.\nFactors that precipitate/aggravate asthma include: allergens, infection, exercise, drugs (aspirin), tobacco,\netc. Symptoms are sometimes worse at night.\nIn children up to 5 years, most initial episodes of asthma-like symptoms are associated with a respiratory tract\ninfection, with no symptoms between infections. Wheezing episodes usually become less frequent with time; most of\nthese children do not develop asthma.\nPage 10 3/ 409\nAcute asthma (asthma attack)\nLast updated: June 2023\nAsthma attack is a substantial worsening of asthma symptoms.

In children, use a spacer a (use face mask in children under 3 years). Single puffs should be given one at a\ntime, let the child breathe 4 to 5 times from the spacer before repeating the procedure. A spacer can also be\nused in adults to increase effectiveness.\nprednisolone PO: one dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) for children over 5 years and adults\noxygen if SpO < 94% b .\n2\nIf the attack is completely resolved:\nObserve the patient for 1 hour (4 hours if they live far from the health centre) then give outpatient\ntreatment: salbutamol MDI for 24 to 48 hours (2 to 4 puffs every 4 to 6 hours depending on clinical evolution)\nand prednisolone PO (same dose as above once daily) to complete 5 days of treatment.\nReassess after 1 to 2 days: address any identified risk factor, reassess need for salbutamol and long-term\ntreatment. If the patient is already receiving long-term treatment, reevaluate the severity of the asthma (see\nChronic asthma), review compliance and correct use of medications and adjust treatment if necessary.\nIf the attack is only partially resolved, continue with salbutamol MDI (2 to 10 puffs every 1 to 4 hours) until\nsymptoms subside. For children up to 5 years, administer one dose of prednisolone PO as above if symptoms\nrecur within 3 to 4 hours. When the attack is completely resolved, proceed as above.\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve, treat as severe attack.\nSevere attack\nHospitalise c ; place the patient in a 1/2 sitting position.\nAdminister:\noxygen to maintain SpO between 94 and 98% b .\n2\nsalbutamol + ipratropium nebuliser solutions using a nebuliser (continue oxygen via nasal cannula during\nnebulisation):\nChildren < 5 years salbutamol 2.5 mg (1.25 ml) + ipratropium 0.25 mg (1 ml) every 20 minutes for the\nfirst hour\nChildren 5 to 11 years salbutamol 2.5 to 5 mg (1.25 to 2.5 ml) + ipratropium 0.5 mg (2 ml) every 20\nminutes for the first hour\nChildren 12 years and over salbutamol 5 mg (2.5 ml) + ipratropium 0.5 mg (2 ml) every 20 minutes for the first\nand adults hour\nThe two solutions should be mixed in the drug reservoir of the nebuliser. Assess symptoms at the end of each\nnebulisation.\nIf there is no nebuliser, use salbutamol MDI (same dose as for mild to moderate attack) and ipratropium MDI\n20 micrograms/puff, 4 to 8 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour.\nprednisolone PO: one dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg)\nIf prednisolone is not available, or if the patient cannot take oral treatment, administer:\nChildren: dexamethasone PO/IV/IM, one dose of 0.15 to 0.6 mg/kg (max. 16 mg)\nAdults: hydrocortisone IV, 4 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) every 6 hours for 24 hours\nIf symptoms do not improve after one hour:\ntransfer to intensive care unit\ninsert an IV line\noxygen to maintain SpO between 94 and 98% b\n2\ncontinue salbutamol (solution for nebuliser) without ipratropium, and corticosteroids as above.\nadminister one dose of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 0.9% sodium chloride over 20 minutes, monitoring\nblood pressure:\nPage 10 5/ 409\nChildren: 40 mg/kg (max. 2 g)\nAdults: 2 g\nIf symptoms improve: continue salbutamol (solution for nebuliser) every 1 to 4 hours (depending on symptoms) and\noxygen as above. Assess symptoms at the end of each nebulisation. When possible, switch to salbutamol MDI\nand continue as for mild to moderate attack.\nIf the attack is completely resolved, observe the patient for at least 4 hours. Continue the treatment with\nsalbutamol (MDI) and prednisolone PO and reassess as for a mild to moderate attack.\nNotes:\nIn pregnant women, treatment is the same as for adults. In mild or moderate asthma attacks, administering oxygen\nreduces the risk of foetal hypoxia.\nFor all patients, irrespective of the severity of the asthma attack, look for underlying lung infection and treat\naccordingly.\nFootnotes\n(a) If a conventional spacer is not available, use a 500 ml plastic bottle: insert the mouthpiece of the inhaler into a hole made in\nthe bottom of the bottle (the seal should be as tight as possible). The patient breathes from the mouth of the bottle in the\nsame way as they would with a spacer. The use of a plastic cup instead of a spacer is not recommended (ineffective).\n(b) If pulse oxymetry is not available, administer oxygen continuously in case of moderate, severe or life-threatening attack.\n(c) If signs of life-threatening attack, transfer to intensive care unit as soon as possible.\nReferences\n1.

These symptoms may appear during or after exercise.\nChest auscultation may be normal or demonstrate diffuse sibilant wheezes.\nA personal or family history of atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis) or a family history of asthma increases\nprobability of asthma but their absence does not exclude asthma.\nPatients with typical symptoms of asthma and a history of disease that is characteristic of asthma should be\nconsidered as having asthma after exclusion of other diagnoses.\nAny identified asthma risk factor (e.g. allergen, pollution, tobacco smoke exposure) should be eliminated where\npossible. The assessment of the frequency of symptoms and limitations of daily activities determines the\ntreatment.\nTreatment\nThe mainstay of long-term treatment are inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA). LABAs\nshould never be used alone but always in combination with an ICS. Combination inhalers are preferred, when available.\nIn addition to long-term treatment, salbutamol (short-acting beta-2 agonist, SABA) and combination inhalers can be\nused to reduce bronchoconstriction if the patient is symptomatic.\nTreatment is started at the step most appropriate to initial severity then, re-evaluated and adjusted according to\nclinical response. An intervening severe asthma attack or loss of control necessitates treatment reassessment.\nThe inhaler is chosen according to age. In children, a spacer should be used. Instructions on inhaler technique and\ninformation on asthma attack symptoms should be provided.\nLong-term treatment of asthma according to severity in children 6 years and over and adults [1] [2]\nPage 10 7/ 409\nSymptoms Children 6 to 11 years Children \u2265 12 years and adults\nIntermittent asthma salbutamol when symptomatic beclometasone/formoterol when\nDaytime symptoms < 2 symptomatic\ntimes monthly\nNormal daily activities OR\nbeclometasone + salbutamol when\nsymptomatic (a)\nMild persistent asthma beclometasone (low dose) daily beclometasone/formoterol when\nDaytime symptoms \u2265 2 AND symptomatic\ntimes monthly salbutamol when symptomatic\nSymptoms may affect\ndaily activities OR\nbeclometasone (low dose) daily\nAND\nsalbutamol when symptomatic\nModerate persistent beclometasone (low dose) beclometasone/formoterol (low dose)\nasthma + salmeterol daily (b) daily\nDaytime symptoms most AND AND\ndays OR nighttime salbutamol when symptomatic beclometasone/formoterol when\nsymptoms \u2265 once weekly symptomatic\nSymptoms affect daily\nactivities OR OR\nbudesonide/formoterol (very low beclometasone (low dose)\ndose) daily + salmeterol daily (b)\nAND AND\nbudesonide/formoterol when salbutamol when symptomatic\nsymptomatic\nSevere persistent asthma beclometasone (medium dose) beclometasone/formoterol (medium\nDaily daytime symptoms + salmeterol daily dose) daily\nOR very frequent AND AND\nnighttime symptoms salbutamol when symptomatic beclometasone/formoterol when\nDaily activities very symptomatic\nlimited by symptoms\nOR OR\nbudesonide/formoterol (low dose) beclometasone (medium dose)\ndaily + salmeterol daily (c)\nAND AND\nbudesonide/formoterol when salbutamol when symptomatic\nsymptomatic\n(a) Salbutamol should be taken just before beclometasone, or together if a combination inhaler is available.\n(b) If salmeterol is not available, use beclometasone medium-dose.\n(c) If salmeterol is not available, use beclometasone high-dose.\nPage 10 8/ 409\nThe doses vary according to the severity of asthma.

The risk of progressing to active tuberculosis is higher in\nimmunocompromised patients. In certain countries, half of newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients are co-infected with\nHIV [1] .\nFor more information on tuberculosis, refer to the guide Tuberculosis, MSF.\nClinical features\nProlonged cough (> 2 weeks) with or without sputum production and/or haemoptysis, prolonged fever, night sweats,\nanorexia, weight loss, chest pain and fatigue.\nDifferential diagnosis includes pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, pulmonary\ndistomatosis (Flukes, Chapter 6) and melioidosis (Southeast Asia).\nIn an endemic area, the diagnosis of tuberculosis is to be considered, in any patient consulting for respiratory\nsymptoms for over 2 weeks who does not respond to non-specific antibacterial treatment.\nLaboratory\nIn the general population: Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF test which simultaneously detects M. tuberculosis (MTB) in sputum and\nresistance to rifampicin (RIF). If not available perform sputum smear microscopy [2] .\nIf HIV co-infection suspected or diagnosed: Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF test and point-of-care, urine LF-LAM (lateral flow\nurine lipoarabinomannan assay) [2] .\nTreatment\nFor pulmonary tuberculosis, the standard treatment is a combination of four antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid,\nrifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). The regimen is organised into 2 phases (initial phase and continuation phase) and\nlasts 6 months.\nIf the strain is drug-resistant, the treatment is longer and different drug combinations are used.\nIt takes significant investment to cure tuberculosis, both from the patient and the medical team. Only uninterrupted\ntreatment will lead to cure and prevent the development of resistance. It is essential that the patient understands the\nimportance of treatment adherence and has access to correct case management until treatment is completed.\nPrevention\nBCG vaccination in neonates: provides 59% protection against pulmonary tuberculosis [3] .\nInfection control in healthcare settings: standard precautions and airborne precautions for confirmed or suspected\ncases.\nClose contacts: isoniazid preventive therapy for 6 months.\nReferences\nPage 11 1/ 409\n1.

This can\nbe prevented by adequate rehydration and nutrition.\nClinical features\nFirst assess for signs of dehydration (see Dehydration, Chapter 1).\nThen look for other signs:\nprofuse watery diarrhoea (cholera, enterotoxigenic E. coli),\nrepeated vomiting (cholera),\nfever (salmonellosis, viral diarrhoea),\npresence of red blood in stools: see also Shigellosis and Amoebiasis (Chapter 3).\nIn a patient over 5 years with severe and rapid onset of dehydration, suspect cholera.\nTreatment\nGeneral principles:\nPrevent or treat dehydration: rehydration consists of prompt replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses as\nrequired, until the diarrhoea stops.\nAdminister zinc sulfate to children under 5 years.\nPrevent malnutrition.\nDo not systematically administer antimicrobials: only certain diarrhoeas require antibiotics (see Antimicrobial\ntreatment).\nDo not administer anti-diarrhoeal drugs or antiemetics.\nTreat the underlying condition if any (malaria, otitis, respiratory infection, etc.).\nPrevention and treatment of dehydration\nSee Dehydration, Chapter 1.\nAdapted treatment protocols are recommended for children with malnutrition (see Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter\n1).\nPrevention of malnutrition\nContinue unrestricted normal diet. In breastfed children, increase the frequency of feeds. Breast milk does not replace\nORS. ORS should be given between feeds.\nZinc supplementation\nPage 11 4/ 409\nZinc sulfate is given in combination with oral rehydration solution in order to reduce the duration and severity of\ndiarrhoea, as well as to prevent further occurrences in the 2 to 3 months after treatment:\nzinc sulfate PO\nChildren under 6 months: 10 mg (\u00bd tablet) once daily for 10 days\nChildren from 6 months to 5 years: 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily for 10 days\nPlace the half-tablet or full tablet in a teaspoon, add a bit of water to dissolve it, and give the entire spoonful to the\nchild.\nAntimicrobial treatment\nDiarrhoea without blood\nMost acute diarrhoeas are caused by viruses unresponsive to antimicrobials. Antimicrobials can be beneficial in the\nevent of cholera or giardiasis.\nCholera: the most important part of treatment is rehydration. In the absence of resistance (perform antibiotic-\nsensitivity testing at the beginning of an outbreak), antibiotic treatment shortens the duration of diarrhoea. See the\nguide Management of a cholera epidemic, MSF.\nGiardiasis: see Intestinal protozoan infections, Chapter 6.\nDiarrhoea with blood\nShigellosis is the most frequent cause of bloody diarrhoea (amoebiasis is much less common). If there is no\nlaboratory diagnosis to confirm the presence of amoebae, first line treatment is for shigellosis (Chapter 3).\nAmoebiasis: antiparasitic treatment only if motile Entamoeba histolytica amoebae are found in stools or if a\ncorrect shigellosis treatment has been ineffective (see Amoebiasis, Chapter 3).\nPrevention\nBreastfeeding reduces infant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea and the severity of diarrhoea episodes.\nWhen the child is weaned preparation and storage of food are associated with the risk of contamination by faecal\nmicro-organisms: discourage bottle-feeding; food must be cooked well; milk or porridge must never be stored at\nroom temperature.\nAccess to sufficient amounts of clean water and personal hygiene (washing hands with soap and water before food\npreparation and before eating, after defecation etc.) are effective methods of reducing the spread of diarrhoea.\nIn countries with a high rotavirus diarrhoea fatality rate, the WHO recommends routine rotavirus vaccination in\nchildren between 6 weeks and 24 months of age [1] .\nReferences\n1.

Transmission is faecal-oral,\nby ingestion of amoebic cysts from food or water contaminated with faeces. Usually, ingested cysts release non-\npathogenic amoebae and 90% of carriers are asymptomatic.\nIn 10% of infected patients, pathogenic amoebae penetrate the mucous of the colon: this is the intestinal amoebiasis\n(amoebic dysentery). The clinical picture is similar to that of shigellosis, which is the principal cause of dysentery.\nOccasionally, the pathogenic amoebae migrate via the blood stream and form peripheral abscesses. Amoebic liver\nabscess is the most common form of extra-intestinal amoebiasis.\nClinical features\nAmoebic dysentery\ndiarrhoea containing red blood and mucus\nabdominal pain, tenesmus\nno fever or moderate fever\npossibly signs of dehydration\nAmoebic liver abscess\npainful hepatomegaly; mild jaundice may be present\nanorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting\nintermittent fever, sweating, chills; change in overall condition\nInvestigations\nAmoebic dysentery: identification of mobile trophozoites (E. histolytica histolytica) in fresh stool samples\nAmoebic liver abscess: indirect haemoagglutination and ELISA\nPOCUS a : perform an EFAST (extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma) examination, with\nadditional views of the liver and spleen to evaluate for signs of amoebic lesions. Contact an expert (local or via\ntelemedicine services) to help interpret the images and differentiate amoebic abscesses from other pathologies\nwith similar characteristics.\nTreatment\nAmoebic dysentery\nThe presence of cysts alone should not lead to the treatment of amoebiasis.\nAmoebiasis confirmed with a parasitological stool examination:\ntinidazole PO\nChildren: 50 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (max. 2 g daily)\nAdults: 2 g once daily for 3 days\nor metronidazole PO\nChildren: 15 mg/kg 3 times daily for 5 days\nAdults: 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days\nIf there is no laboratory, first line treatment for dysentery is for shigellosis.

Recurrent episodes\ncharacteristically last a few days and are often accompanied by nausea and even vomiting.\nThe most common complications are perforation and bleeding.\nTreatment of non-complicated ulcers\nFor an isolated episode:\nidentify patients taking NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid; stop treatment;\nencourage patients to avoid alcohol and tobacco use;\nomeprazole PO: 20 mg once daily in the morning for 7 to 10 days. In severe or recurrent cases, dose can be\nincreased to 40 mg once daily and the treatment can be prolonged for up to 8 weeks.\nIf the patient has frequent recurrences unrelated to NSAID use, that require repeated treatment with antiulcer drugs:\nsee eradication of Helicobacter pylori.\nTreatment of complicated ulcers\nPerforation\nPerforation should be considered in patients presenting with sudden onset intense epigastric pain, particularly if there is\nrigidity of the abdominal wall. The risk of peritonitis is increased if the perforation occurs on a full stomach.\nTo start:\nplace the patient on a strict fast (NPO); insert a nasogastric tube and aspirate if possible;\ninsert an intravenous line and hydrate (Ringer lactate);\ntreat acute pain (see Pain, Chapter 1);\nomeprazole IV infusion: 40 mg once daily over 20 to 30 minutes\nRefer to a surgeon.\nIf referral not possible, risk of mortality is high:\nContinue conservative management including maintenance fluid (alternate 5% glucose and Ringer lactate).\nStart IV antibiotics (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nIf after 3 days, the patient's clinical condition has improved, cautiously restart oral feeding, remove the\nnasogastric tube and start PO treatment to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (see eradication of Helicobacter\npylori).\nGastrointestinal bleeding\nPassing of black stool (maelena) and/or vomiting blood (haematemesis). In 80% of cases the bleeding stops\nspontaneously.\nInsert a nasogastric tube for aspiration and insert an IV line (16G).\nIf the haemodynamic state is stable (pulse and blood pressure are normal):\nHydrate (Ringer lactate), monitor, keep NPO for 12 hours.\nIf there is no active haemorrhage, restart oral feeding after 12 hours.\nGastric lavage with cold water is not essential, but may help evaluate persistence of bleeding.\nIf the haemorrhage continues (haematemesis) and/or if the haemodynamic state deteriorates (pulse increases, BP\ndrops):\nPage 12 2/ 409\nIntensive care and transfusion according to the severity of the bleeding (see haemorrhagic shock, Chapter 1).\nEmergency surgical intervention.\nEradication of Helicobacter pylori\nMost peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. If a diagnosis of ulcer is probable, treatment to\neradicate H. pylori should be considered if the patient has frequent attacks requiring repeated and/or prolonged\ntreatments with antiulcer drugs over 8 weeks or in cases of complicated ulcers (perforation or gastrointestinal\nbleeding). Infection should be confirmed with a test where possible.\nH. pylori resistance to antibiotics varies globally, follow national recommendations where available. If not, for\ninformation, administer a triple therapy for 7 days:\nomeprazole PO 20 mg 2 times daily + clarithromycin PO 500 mg 2 times daily + amoxicillin PO 1 g 2 times daily a .\nIn immunocompromised patients, consider mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection or other nontuberculous\nmycobacterium (NTM) infection prior to starting a clarithromycin-containing triple therapy.\nIf symptoms continue despite treatment, consider the differential diagnosis of gastric cancer. Refer for investigations\nif possible.\nNotes:\nAcetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and NSAID (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.) are contra-indicated in patients suffering from\nor with a history of ulcers.\nOmeprazole is as effective PO as IV.\nFootnotes\n(a) In penicillin-allergic patients, amoxicillin PO can be substituted with metronidazole PO 500 mg 2 times daily.\nPage 12 3/ 409\nDyspepsia\nLast updated: December 2020\nClinical features\nEpigastric pain or discomfort following meals, often accompanied by bloating, sensation of fullness and nausea.\nDyspepsia is most commonly functional. The diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is based on clinical assessment after\nruling out organic causes (Gastro-oesophageal reflux, Gastric and duodenal ulcers, drug-induced symptoms, gastric\ncancer). If possible, test for Helicobacter pylori.\nTreatment\nIn adults:\nIn case of patients who test positive for H. pylori, see Eradication of Helicobacter pylori [1] .\nOmeprazole PO (10 mg once daily) for 4 weeks may help even in H. pylori-negative patients [2] [3] .\nNote: consider and treat possible intestinal parasites (see Intestinal protozoan infections, Cestodes, Nematode\ninfections, Chapter 6; Amoebiasis, Chapter 3).\nReferences\n1.

They must be treated individually or collectively,\nbut must also be considered as indicators of the sanitary condition of a population. A high prevalence of infectious skin\ndiseases may reflect a problem of insufficient water quantity and lack of hygiene in a population.\nDermatological examination\nObserve the type of lesion:\nMacule: flat, non palpable lesion that is different in colour than the surrounding skin\nPapule: small (< 1 cm) slightly elevated, circumscribed, solid lesion\nVesicle (< 1 cm), bulla (> 1 cm): clear fluid-filled blisters\nPustule: vesicle containing pus\nNodule: firm, elevated palpable lesion (> 1 cm) that extend into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue\nErosion: loss of the epidermis that heals without leaving a scar\nExcoriation: erosion caused by scratching\nUlcer: loss of the epidermis and at least part of the dermis that leaves a scar\nScale: flake of epidermis that detaches from the skin surface\nCrust: dried serum, blood, or pus on the skin surface\nAtrophy: thinning of the skin\nLichenification: thickening of the skin with accentuation of normal skin markings\nLook at the distribution of the lesions over the body; observe their arrangement: isolated, clustered, linear, annular\n(in a ring). Ask if the lesions are itchy.\nLook for a possible cause: insect bites; scabies, lice, other parasitic skin infections; contact with plants, animals,\njewellery, detergents, etc.\nAsk about any past or ongoing treatment: topical, oral or parenteral.\nLook for local or regional signs (secondary infection, lymphangitis, adenopathy, erysipelas) and/or systemic signs\n(fever, septicaemia, secondary focus).\nConsider the sanitary conditions of the family, particularly for contagious skin diseases (scabies, scalp ringworm,\nlice).\nCheck tetanus vaccination status.\nPatients with skin disease often present late. At this stage, primary lesions and specific signs may be masked by\nsecondary infection. In these cases, it is necessary to re-examine the patient, after treating the secondary infection, in\norder to identify and treat the underlying skin disease.\nPage 13 2/ 409\nScabies\nScabies is a cutaneous parasitosis due to the presence of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei hominis within the epidermis. It\nexists in two forms: ordinary scabies, relatively benign and moderately contagious; and crusted scabies, favoured by\nimmune deficiency, extremely contagious and refractory to conventional treatment.\nPerson to person transmission takes place chiefly through direct skin contact, and sometimes by indirect contact\n(sharing clothing, bedding). The challenge in management is that it must include simultaneous treatment of both the\npatient and close contacts, and at the same time, decontamination of clothing and bedding of all persons undergoing\ntreatment, in order to break the transmission cycle.\nClinical features\nOrdinary scabies\nIn older children and adults\nItching, worse at night, very suggestive of scabies if close contacts have the same symptom\nand\nTypical skin lesions:\nScabies burrows (common): fine wavy lines of 5 to 15 mm, corresponding to the tunnels made by the parasite\nwithin the skin. Burrows are most often seen in the interdigital spaces of the hand and flexor aspect of the wrist,\nbut may be present on the areolae, buttocks, elbows, axillae. The back and the face are spared. Burrows may\nbe associated with vesicles, corresponding to the entry point of the parasite in the skin.\nScabies nodules (less common): reddish-brown nodules, measuring 2 to 20 mm, on the genitals in men, persisting\nafter effective treatment (they are not necessarily indicative of active infection).\nand/or\nSecondary skin lesions: resulting from scratching (excoriations, crusts) or super-infection (impetigo).\nTypical lesions and secondary lesions may co-exist, or specific lesions may be entirely masked by secondary lesions.\nIn infants and young children\nVesicular eruption; often involving palms and soles, back, face, and limbs. Secondary infection or eczematisation is\nfrequent. Isolated scabies nodules in the axillae may be the only manifestation.\nExamination of the mother\u2019s hands may support the diagnosis.\nCrusted (Norwegian) scabies\nThick, scaly, erythematous plaques, generalised or localised, resembling psoriasis, with or without itching (50% of\ncases). Delay in diagnosis may lead to a scabies epidemic.\nTreatment\nIn all cases\nClose contacts of the patient are treated simultaneously, even in the absence of symptoms.\nClothing and bedding (including that of contacts) are changed after each treatment. They are washed at \u2265 60 \u00b0C\nthen dried in the sun, or exposed to sunlight for 72 hours, or sealed in a plastic bag for 72 hours.\nOrdinary scabies\nPage 13 3/ 409\nTopical treatment\nTopical scabicides are applied over the entire body (including the scalp, post-auricular areas, umbilicus, palms and\nsoles), avoiding mucous membranes and face, and the breasts in breastfeeding women. Particular attention should be\npaid to common infestation sites. The recommended contact time should not be shortened or exceeded; the patient\nmust not wash his hands while the product is in use (or the product should be reapplied if the hands are washed). In\nchildren under 2 years, the hands must be wrapped to prevent accidental ingestion of the product and contact with\neyes. Topical scabicides should not be applied to broken or inflamed skin. Treatment of secondary bacterial infection,\nif present, should be initiated 24 to 48 hours before use of topical scabicides (see Impetigo).\nThe preferred treatment is 5% permethrin cream:\nChildren 2 months and over and adults: one application, with a contact time of 8 hours, then rinse thoroughly. Repeat\nthe application after 7 days.\nor, if not available, 25% benzyl benzoate lotion:\nSee the table below for dilution (depending on age), contact time and number of applications.\nChildren\nChildren Children Pregnant\n> 12 years\n< 2 years 2 to 12 years women\nand adults\nLotion must be\nLotion must be diluted before\ndiluted before use: use: Use undiluted Use undiluted\nDilution\n1 part 25% lotion + 1 part 25% 25% lotion 25% lotion\n3 parts water lotion + 1 part\nwater\n12 hours (6 hours\nfor infants\n24 hours then 24 hours then 12 hours then\nContact time < 6 months)\nrinse thoroughly rinse thoroughly rinse thoroughly\nthen rinse\nthoroughly\nTwo applications (e.g. 24 hours\napart, with a rinse between the 2\napplications; or 2 successive\nNumber of applications One application One application\napplications, 10 minutes apart,\nwhen the first application has dried\nwith a rinse after 24 hours)\nOral treatment\nTreatment with ivermectin PO (200 micrograms/kg single dose) is an alternative: it is more practical than topical\ntreatment (e.g. in the case of an epidemic or for treating contacts) and can be started right away in the case of\nsecondary infection. A single dose may be sufficient; a second dose 7 days later reduces the risk of treatment failure.\nIvermectin is not recommended for children < 15 kg or pregnant women (safety not established) a .\nAdministration of ivermectin to patients with loiasis carries a risk of severe neurological complications when significant\nLoa loa microfilaraemia is present (see Filariasis, Chapter 6) b .\nivermectin PO single dose:\nPage 13 4/ 409\nWeight 15 to 24 kg 25 to 35 kg 36 to 50 kg 51 to 65 kg\nIvermectin 3 mg tab 1 tab 2 tab 3 tab 4 tab\nTreatment effectiveness is judged on clinical grounds. Itching may persist for 1 to 3 weeks after elimination of the\nparasite.\nPersistence of typical burrows beyond 4 weeks should lead to suspicion of treatment failure (insufficient treatment,\ne.g. the scalp was not included in topical treatment or the patient washed his hands during the treatment period), or\nearly re-infestation (contacts and environment not treated). In these cases, patient and contacts should be retreated.\nPersistent itching may be due to another condition, initially masked by scabies.\nCrusted scabies\nTreatment combines simultaneous administration of oral ivermectin and topical scabicide at regular intervals, e.g. every\nweek for 2 to 3 weeks or more, according to severity and clinical response.\nCrusts should be softened (salicylic acid ointment) and removed before applying local treatment (otherwise, local\ntreatment is ineffective).\nAs exfoliated skin scales may spread the parasite, the patient should be isolated during the treatment, staff should use\nprotection (gloves, gowns and hand washing after contact), and environment (bedding, floors and surfaces) should be\ndecontaminated.\nFootnotes\n(a) Treatment with ivermectin in these patients is reserved for severe cases for which no alternative exists (see Crusted\nscabies).\n(b) In areas where loiasis is endemic, certain precautions are recommended before administering ivermectin: e.g. measure the\nLoa loa microfilaraemia, if possible, or ensure that the patient has no history of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the\nconjunctiva or transient \u00ab Calabar \u00bb swellings), nor history of severe adverse reactions following a previous treatment with\nivermectin, or if in doubt, use topical treatment in preference to oral.\nPage 13 5/ 409\nLice (pediculosis)\nPediculosis is a benign contagious parasitic infection due to 3 species of lice specific to humans: head lice, body lice\nand pubic lice. Transmission from person to person occurs through direct or indirect contact.\nBody lice are potential vectors of relapsing fever (Chapter 7), typhus (Eruptive rickettsioses, Chapter 7) and trench\nfever.\nClinical features\nHead lice mainly affect children: itching and scratch marks (nape of neck and around the ears), which may become\nsecondarily infected (impetigo) in prolonged infestation; presence of live lice and/or live (shiny, grey) nits attached to\nthe hair shaft within 5 mm of the scalp.\nBody lice mainly affect populations living under poor conditions (refugees, prisoners, the homeless): itching and\nscratch marks (back, belt line and armpits), often inflamed and infected; presence of lice and nits in the clothing\n(parasites are not found on the body).\nPubic lice are considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI): itching and scratch marks (pubic and perianal\narea), but other hairy areas may also be affected (armpits, thighs, eyelashes); lice and nits at the base of the hair\nshaft, rarely visible.\nExamine contacts; check for associated systemic infection (body lice) or STI (pubic lice).\nTreatment\nHead lice\nApply lotion to scalp and dry hair, paying particular attention to the areas behind the ears and around the nape of the\nneck. Do not reduce or exceed the recommended duration of application.\n4% dimeticone lotion\nChildren 6 months and over and adults: leave on hair for 8 hours, then rinse thoroughly.\nKeep away from flames and/or intense heat sources (including cigarettes) during application and until rinsing (risk of\nignition).\nor, if dimeticone is not available or in children 2 to 6 months:\n1% permethrin lotion.\nChildren 2 months and over and adults: leave on hair for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.\nRepeat application of either treatment after 7 days.\nDecontaminate combs, headwear and bedding (wash \u2265 60 \u00b0C/30 minutes, iron or dry in the sun or, if not feasible,\nseal in a plastic bag for 2 weeks).\nTreat as above contacts with live lice and/or live nits. Do not treat those with dead nits alone (dull, white, > 1 cm\nfrom scalp).\nBody lice\nMass treatment (outbreak)\nApply 30 to 60 g (2 to 4 heaped soup spoons) of 0.5% permethrin powder to the inside of the clothes and\nunderclothes in contact with the skin (front and back, neck and waistline, sleeves and socks) in a fully clothed patient,\nthen rub in the powder by hand. Leave for 12 to 24 hours.\nTreat other clothing (including headwear) and bedding in a plastic bag with 0.5% permethrin powder. Repeat in 8 to 10\ndays if the infestation persists.\nPage 13 6/ 409\nIndividual treatment\nDisinfection of clothing and bedding as above or as for head lice.\nPubic lice\nShave and/or apply 1% permethrin lotion to hairy areas (as for head lice). Treat the partner at the same time.\nDecontaminate clothing and bedding (as for head lice). Repeat the application after 7 days.\nTreatment of secondary bacterial infection, if present, should begin 24 to 48 hours before local antiparasitic treatment\n(see Impetigo); local treatment is applied later when tolerated.\nPage 13 7/ 409\nSuperficial fungal infections\nSuperficial fungal infections are benign infections of the skin, scalp and nails caused by Candida albicans or\ndermatophytes.\nClinical features and treatment\nCandidiasis\nCandidal diaper dermatitis\nErythema of the perianal area with peripheral desquamation and sometimes pustules. Secondary infection may\ndevelop.\nButtocks must be kept clean (ordinary soap and water) and dry.\nAvoid humidity: according to the context, expose the buttocks to air or change diapers more frequently; remove\nplastic pants.\nProtect the skin with zinc oxide ointment if diarrhoea is present.\nIf diaper dermatitis is severe and persistent despite these measures, consider an intestinal infection (nystatin PO:\n100 000 IU 4 times daily for 20 days).\nOther candidiasis\nCandidiasis of skin folds: miconazole 2% cream, one application 2 times daily for 2 to 4 weeks\nOral candidiasis: see Stomatitis, Chapter 3.\nVulvovaginal candidiasis: see Abnormal vaginal discharge, Chapter 9.\nDermatophytoses\nDermatophytes cause various clinical lesions, depending on the anatomic site involved: scalp, glabrous (hairless) skin,\nfolds or nails.\nPage 13 8/ 409\nAnatomic\nClinical features Treatment\nsite (a)\nScalp Common in children.

Treatment is prolonged (12 to 18 months with\ngriseofulvin) thus, in practice, difficult. Failures and relapses are frequent.\n(b) In candidal intertrigo, lesions are usually located in the 1st and 2nd interdigital spaces.\nPage 14 0/ 409\nBacterial skin infections\nImpetigo\nFuruncles and carbuncles\nErysipelas and cellulitis\nPage 14 1/ 409\nImpetigo\nImpetigo is a benign, contagious infection of the epidermis due to group A \u00df-haemolytic streptococcus\nand Staphylococcus aureus. Co-infection is common. Transmission is by direct contact. Lack of water, and poor\nhygiene, increase spread.\nPrimary infections are most common in children. Secondary infections complicating preexisting pruritic dermatoses\n(lice, scabies, eczema, herpes, chickenpox, etc.) are more common in adults.\nClinical features\nNon bullous impetigo (classic form): flaccid vesicle on erythematous skin which becomes pustular and forms a\nyellowish crust. Different stages o the infection may be present simultaneously. The lesion does not leave a scar.\nThe most common sites of infection are around the nose and mouth, on the limbs or on the scalp.\nBullous impetigo: large flaccid bullae and erosions of the skin in the ano-genital region in newborns and infants.\nEcthyma: an ulcerative form of impetigo that leaves scars. This form is most common in the immunocompromised\n(e.g. HIV infection, malnutrition), diabetics and alcoholics.\nRegardless of the type of impetigo: absence of fever or systemic signs.\nPossible complications:\nabscess, pyodermitis, cellulitis, lymphangitis, osteomyelitis, septicaemia;\nacute glomerulonephritis (routinely look for signs of glomerulonephritis).\nTreatment\nLocalised non bullous impetigo (max. 5 lesions in a single skin area):\nClean with soap and water and dry before applying mupirocin.\n2% mupirocin ointment: one application 3 times daily for 7 days. Reassess after 3 days. If there is no response,\nswitch to oral antibiotic therapy (see below).\nKeep fingernails short. Avoid touching the lesions, keep them covered with gauze if possible.\nExtensive non bullous impetigo (more than 5 lesions or impetigo involving more than one skin area), bullous\nimpetigo, ecthyma, impetigo with abscess; immunocompromised patient; topical treatment failure:\nClean with soap and water and dry 2 to 3 times daily.\nKeep fingernails short. Avoid touching the lesions, keep them covered with gauze if possible.\nIncise abscesses if present.\nAdminister oral antibiotic therapy a :\ncefalexin PO for 7 days\nNeonates under 7 days: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nNeonates 7 to 28 days: 25 mg/kg 3 times daily\nChildren 1 month to 12 years: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily\nor\ncloxacillin PO for 7 days\nChildren over 10 years: 15 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily)\nAdults: 1 g 3 times daily\nNote: in newborns with lesions located around the umbilicus, administer cloxacilllin IV.\nFor all patients:\nQuarantine from school (children can return to school after 24 to 48 hours of antibiotic therapy).\nPage 14 2/ 409\nLook for and treat any underlying dermatosis: lice, scabies, eczema, herpes, scalp ringworm, or an ENT\ninfection.\nTrace and treat contacts.\nCheck for proteinuria (use urine dipstick) 3 weeks after the infection.\nFootnotes\n(a) In penicillin-allergic patients only (resistance to macrolides is common), azithromycin PO for 3 days (children: 10 mg/kg once\ndaily; adults: 500 mg once daily).\nPage 14 3/ 409\nFuruncles and carbuncles\nNecrotising perifollicular infection, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors include: nasal carriage of S.\naureus, maceration, breaks in the skin, poor hygiene; diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, iron deficiency or\nimmunodeficiency.\nClinical features\nFuruncle: red, warm, painful nodule with a central pustule, usually around a hair follicle. It becomes fluctuant,\ndischarges a core of purulent exudate, and leaves a depressed scar. It occurs most frequently on the thighs, groin,\nbuttocks, armpits, neck and back. There is no fever.\nCarbuncle: a cluster of interconnected furuncles, sometimes with fever and peripheral lymphadenopathy. It leaves a\ndepressed scar.\nTreatment\nSingle furuncle:\nClean with soap and water 2 times daily and cover with a dry dressing.\nApply warm moist compresses to the furuncle in order to encourage it to drain.\nAfter drainage, clean and apply a dry dressing until the lesion has healed.\nFuruncle on the face, multiple furuncles, carbuncles or in immunocompromised patients:\nSame local care.\nAdd systematically an antibiotic for 7 days a :\ncefalexin PO\nNeonates under 7 days: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nNeonates 7 to 28 days: 25 mg/kg 3 times daily\nChildren 1 month to 12 years: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily\nor\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO.

If the orbital and periorbital tissues\nare infected, see Periorbital and orbital cellulitis, Chapter 5. If the infection is perifollicular, see Furuncles and\ncarbuncles, Chapter 4.\nClinical signs\nWarm, tender, swollen well\u2013demarcated erythematous plaque.\nFever, lymphadenopathy and lymphangitis.\nLook for a portal of entry (bite, ulcer, wound, intertrigo, eczema, fungal infection, etc.).\nIn case of intense pain disproportionate to the skin lesion, hypoesthesia, rapidly progressing local signs, crepitation,\nskin necrosis or critically ill appearing patient, consider necrotising fasciitis that is a surgical emergency\n(see Necrotising infections of the skin and soft tissues, Chapter 10).\nOther complications: septicaemia (see Septic shock, Chapter 1), acute glomerulonephritis, osteomyelitis, septic\narthritis.\nThe main differential diagnoses include: contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis due to venous insufficiency, venous\nthrombosis and erythema migrans characteristic of Lyme disease.\nParaclinical investigations\nUltrasound: can detect signs of cellulitis and rule out an underlying abscess, deep vein thrombosis or a foreign body.\nRadiography: can detect a foreign body, underlying osteomyelitis (or gas in the subcutaneous tissue in case of a\nnecrotising infection, nevertheless the absence of gas does not rule out this diagnosis).\nTest for proteinuria with urine dipstick 3 weeks after infection to look for glomerulonephritis.\nTreatment\nIn all cases:\nOutline the area of erythema with a pen in order to follow the infection a .\nBed rest, elevation of affected area (e.g. leg).\nTreatment of pain (Chapter 1).

Humans may become infected through contact of broken skin with a dead or sick animal. People at risk\ninclude livestock farmers and those that manipulate skins, wool or carcasses of infected animals.\nThe disease is found in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, Africa and South America.\nPulmonary (acquired by inhalation) and intestinal (acquired by eating infected meat) forms also exist.\nClinical features\nPapule, then pruritic vesicle on uncovered skin surfaces (face, neck, arms, legs). The vesicle ulcerates and becomes\na painless black eschar surrounded by oedema, often associated with with lymphangitis and regional\nlymphadenopathy.\nThe following are criteria of severity:\nlesion located on the head or neck, or\npresence of systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, headache, tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypotension,\nhyper/hypothermia), or\npresence of extensive oedema, or\nmultiple, extensive or bullous lesions.\nLaboratory\nFrom vesicular fluid a : culture and drug susceptibility testing (rarely available) or Gram stain for microscopic\nexamination.\nPCR testing (reference laboratory).\nTreatment\nUncomplicated cutaneous anthrax\nDo not excise the eschar; daily dry dressings.\nAntibiotic treatment for 7 to 10 days:\nFirst-line antibiotics:\nciprofloxacin PO (including in pregnant or breastfeeding women and children)\nChildren: 15 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) 2 times daily\nAdults: 500 mg 2 times daily\nor\ndoxycycline PO (except in pregnant or breastfeeding women)\nChildren under 45 kg: 2 to 2.2 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) 2 times daily\nChildren 45 kg and over and adults: 100 mg 2 times daily\nAlternatives include:\nclindamycin PO (in patients allergic to first-line antibiotics)\nChildren: 10 mg/kg (max. 600 mg) 3 times daily\nAdults: 600 mg 3 times daily\nor\nPage 14 8/ 409\namoxicillin PO, if penicillins are effective (documented susceptibility)\nChildren: 30 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 3 times daily\nAdults: 1 g 3 times daily\nSevere cutaneous anthrax\nCombined antibiotic treatment for 14 days:\nDo not mix the two antibiotics in the same infusion bag (incompatibility).\nFirst-line:\nciprofloxacin IV infusion over 60 minutes b\nChildren: 10 mg/kg (max. 400 mg) every 8 hours\nAdults: 400 mg every 8 hours\n+ clindamycin IV infusion over 30 minutes b\nChildren 1 month and over: 10 to 13 mg/kg (max. 900 mg) every 8 hours\nAdults: 900 mg every 8 hours\nAlternative, if penicillins are effective (documented susceptibility):\nampicillin IV infusion over 30 minutes b\nChildren 1 month and over: 50 mg/kg (max. 3 g) every 6 hours or 65 mg/kg (max. 4 g) every 8 hours\nAdults: 3 g every 6 hours or 4 g every 8 hours\n+ clindamycin IV infusion as above.\nChange to oral treatment as soon as possible to complete 14 days of treatment with ciprofloxacin + clindamycin or\namoxicillin + clindamycin as for uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax.\nIntensive care: symptomatic treatment of shock (see Shock, Chapter 1); tracheostomy and ventilatory support may\nbe necessary.\nPrevention\nAntibiotic prophylaxis in case of known skin exposure: treat for 10 days PO as for uncomplicated cutaneous\nanthrax.\nLivestock vaccination; burial or burning of animal carcasses.\nFootnotes\n(a) Samples can be stored (including transport time) for 7 days max. in cold chain (if not available, at a temperature < 30 \u00b0C).\n(b) Dilute each dose of ciprofloxacin, clindamycin or ampicillin in 5 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose in children less\nthan 20 kg and in a bag of 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose in children 20 kg and above and in adults.\nAdminister ciprofloxacin more slowly than clindamycin or ampicillin.\nPage 14 9/ 409\nEndemic treponematoses\nEndemic treponematoses are bacterial infections caused by 3 different types of treponema (other than Treponema\npallidum).

[1]\nClinical features\nLeprosy should be considered in any patient presenting with:\nHypopigmented or erythematous skin lesion(s) with partial or complete loss of sensation to touch, pain, heat;\nInfiltrated pigmented nodules, initially with no sensory loss, on the face, ear lobes and the upper and lower limbs;\nTender, infiltrated and hypertrophied peripheral nerve (ulnar, radial, median, popliteal, tibial etc.) with possible\nparaesthesia of the extremities, trophic changes (perforating ulcer of the foot) or paralysis (steppage gait,\ndeformaties of hands and feet, facial nerve paralysis).\nThere are different clinical forms and classification systems of leprosy.\nRidley-Jopling classification\nThis classification differentiates 5 forms based on the bacteriological index. These forms correlate with the\nimmunological response to M. leprae. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy (TT) are resistant to the bacillus and infection\nis localised. Patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL) are extremely sensitive to the bacillus and the infection is\ndisseminated. Borderline forms (BT, BB, BL) are between the two ends of the spectrum (TT and LL).\nPaucibacillary forms Multibacillary forms\n(least contagious forms) (most contagious forms)\nTuberculoid Borderline Borderline Borderline Lepromatous\nTuberculoid Lepromatous\nT.T. B.T. B.B. B.L. L.L.\nWHO classification\nIn order to simplify diagnosis and to promote rapid implementation of treatment, the WHO has simplified clinical\nclassification of leprosy and differentiates only 2 forms:\nMultibacillary leprosy: more than 5 skin lesions\nPaucibacillary leprosy: 1 to 5 skin lesions\nMultibacillary leprosy includes LL, BL and BB forms and paucibacillary leprosy includes the TT and BT forms of the\nRidley-Jopling classification system.\nLaboratory\nLaboratory diagnosis is based on the detection of acid-fast bacilli in a Ziehl-Neelsen stained nasal smear and skin-\nsplit smear taken from the ear lobe or from a skin lesion. In TT leprosy bacilli are not found.\nIn practice, in most endemic countries diagnosis is based on the WHO clinical classification (number of lesions).\nPage 15 3/ 409\nTreatment\nCountries where leprosy is endemic have a control programme. Check national recommendations.\nFirst-line treatment regimens recommended by the WHO\nMultibacillary leprosy Paucibacillary leprosy\nAge\n(more than 5 skin lesions) (1 to 5 skin lesions)\nChildren 10 to 14 years rifampicin PO: 450 mg once monthly rifampicin PO: 450 mg once monthly\n+ clofazimine PO: 150 mg once monthly + clofazimine PO: 150 mg once monthly\nand 50 mg on alternate days and 50 mg on alternate days\n+ dapsone PO: 50 mg once daily + dapsone PO: 50 mg once daily\nChildren 15 years and rifampicin PO: 600 mg once monthly rifampicin PO: 600 mg once monthly\nover and adults + clofazimine PO: 300 mg once monthly + clofazimine PO: 300 mg once monthly\nand 50 mg once daily and 50 mg once daily\n+ dapsone PO: 100 mg once daily + dapsone PO: 100 mg once daily\nDuration 12 months 6 months\nNote: the monthly doses of rifampicin and clofazimine are administered under direct observation by medical staff\nwhereas the daily doses of clofazimine and dapsone are taken by the patient at home. Rifampicin should be taken on\nan empty stomach to improve absorption.\nTeach the patient to recognise and quickly report a lepra reaction or relapse in order to modify or restart treatment.\nLeprosy reactions\nThese reactions usually occur during the course of treatment in patients with multibacillary leprosy (BL and LL). They\nare associated with the immunological response to M. leprae antigens. Urgent treatment is required to avoid\nirreversible disability. Do not interrupt ongoing leprosy treatment.\nClinical features\nReversal reactions:\nExacerbation of the skin lesions that become erythematous and oedematous and risk or ulceration. Onset or\nworsening of numbness of skin lesions;\nOnset of acute painful hypertrophic neuritis.\nErythema nodosum leprosum:\nFever, asthenia, alteration of the general state;\nCrops of purplish-red, tender subcutaneous nodules, warmer than the surrounding skin.\nTreatment\nReversal reactions:\nprednisolone (or prednisone) PO: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg once daily for 2 weeks. Re-examine the patient every 2 weeks\nand decrease the dosage if the neurological signs recede. According to clinical response, treatment may last 3 to 6\nmonths. [2]\nFor example, for an adult: [3]\nWeek 1 and 2: 40 mg once daily\nPage 15 4/ 409\nWeek 3 and 4: 30 mg once daily\nWeek 5 and 6: 20 mg once daily\nWeek 7 and 8: 15 mg once daily\nWeek 9 and 10: 10 mg once daily\nWeek 11 and 12: 5 mg once daily\nErythema nodosum leprosum:\nprednisolone (or prednisone) PO as for reversal reactions, for 3 months.

Xerophthalmia can progress to\nirreversible blindness if left untreated.\nIn endemic areas, vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia affect mainly children (particularly those suffering from\nmalnutrition or measles) and pregnant women.\nDisorders due to vitamin A deficiency can be prevented by the routine administration of retinol.\nClinical features\nThe first sign is hemeralopia (crepuscular blindness): the child cannot see in dim light, may bump into objects and/or\nshow decreased mobility.\nThen, other signs appear gradually:\nConjunctival xerosis: bulbar conjunctiva appears dry, dull, thick, wrinkled and insensitive\nBitot\u2019s spots: greyish foamy patches on the bulbar conjunctiva, usually in both eyes (specific sign, however not\nalways present)\nCorneal xerosis: cornea appears dry and dull\nCorneal ulcerations\nKeratomalacia (the last and most severe sign of xerophthalmia): softening of the cornea, followed by\nperforation of the eyeball and blindness (extreme care must be taken during ophthalmic examination due to risk\nof rupturing cornea)\nTreatment\nTreat early symptoms to avoid the development of severe complications. Vision can be saved provided that\nulcerations affect less than a third of the cornea and the pupil is spared. Even if deficiency has already led to\nkeratomalacia and irreversible loss of sight, it is imperative to administer treatment, in order to save the other eye and\nthe life of the patient.\nretinol (vitamin A) PO:\nTreatment is the same regardless of the clinical stage, except in pregnant women.\nAge 200 000 IU capsule (a)\nChildren < 6 months (b) 50 000 IU (2 drops) once daily on D1, D2 and D8\nChildren 6 months to < 1 year 100 000 IU (4 drops) once daily on D1, D2 and D8\nChildren \u2265 1 year and adults 200 000 IU (one capsule) once daily on D1, D2 and D8\n(a) Capsules must not be swallowed whole. Cut the end of the capsule and deliver the dose directly into the mouth.\n(b) Vitamin A deficiency is rare in breastfed infants under 6 months.\nIn pregnant women, treatment varies according to the stage of illness:\nHemeralopia or Bitot's spots: 10 000 IU once daily or 25 000 IU once weekly for at least 4 weeks. Do not\nexceed indicated doses (risk of foetal malformations).\nPage 16 5/ 409\nIf the cornea is affected, risk of blindness outweighs teratogenic risk. Administer 200 000 IU once daily on D1,\nD2 and D8.\nCorneal lesions are a medical emergency. In addition to the immediate administration of retinol, treat or prevent\nsecondary bacterial infections with 1% tetracycline eye ointment, one application 2 times daily (do not apply eye\ndrops containing corticosteroids) and protect the eye with an eye-pad after each application.\nPrevention\nSystematically administer retinol PO to children suffering from measles (one dose on D1 and D2).\nIn areas where vitamin A deficiency is endemic a , routine supplementation of retinol PO:\nAge 200 000 IU capsule (c)\nChildren < 6 months 50 000 IU (2 drops) single dose\nChildren 6 months to < 1 year 100 000 IU (4 drops) every 4 to 6 months\nChildren 1 to < 5 years 200 000 IU (one capsule) every 4 to 6 months\nWomen after delivery 200 000 IU (one capsule) single dose\n(c) Capsules must not be swallowed whole. Cut the end of the capsule and deliver the dose directly into the mouth.\nTo avoid excessive dosage, record any doses administered on the health/immunisation card and do not exceed\nindicated doses. Vitamin A overdose may cause raised intracranial pressure (bulging fontanelle in infants; headache,\nnausea, vomiting) and, in severe cases, impaired consciousness and convulsions. These adverse effects are transient;\nthey require medical surveillance and symptomatic treatment if needed.\nFootnotes\n(a) For more information country-specific prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, see:\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2815%2900039-X\nPage 16 6/ 409\nConjunctivitis\nNeonatal conjunctivitis\nViral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis is an acute inflammation of the conjunctiva due to a bacterial or viral infection, allergy, or irritation.\nConjunctivitis may be associated with measles or rhinopharyngitis in children.\nIn the absence of hygiene and effective treatment, secondary bacterial infections may develop, affecting the cornea\n(keratitis).\nClinical features\nClinical signs of all conjuctivites include: redness of the eye and irritation.

The disease is endemic in the\npoorest rural areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and the Middle East.\nInfection is usually first contracted early in childhood by direct or indirect contact (dirty hands, contaminated towels,\nflies). In the absence of hygiene and effective treatment, the inflammation intensifies with successive infections,\ncausing scars and deformities on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting ingrowing eyelashes (trichiasis) cause\ncorneal lesions followed by permanent blindness, usually in adulthood.\nThe WHO classifies trachoma into 5 stages. Early diagnosis and treatment of first stages is essential to avoid the\ndevelopment of trichiasis and associated complications.\nClinical features\nSeveral stages can occur simultaneously [1] [2] :\nStage 1: trachomatous inflammation - follicular (TF)\nPresence of five or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Follicles are whitish, grey or yellow elevations,\npaler than the surrounding conjunctiva.\nStage 2: trachomatous inflammation - intense (TI)\nThe upper tarsal conjunctiva is red, rough and thickened. The blood vessels, normally visible, are masked by a\ndiffuse inflammatory infiltration or follicles.\nStage 3: trachomatous scarring (TS)\nFollicles disappear, leaving scars: scars are white lines, bands or patches in the tarsal conjunctiva.\nStage 4: trachomatous trichiasis (TT)\nDue to multiple scars the margin of the eyelid, usually the upper lid, turns inwards (entropion); the eyelashes rub\nagainst the cornea and cause ulcerations and chronic inflammation.\nStage 5: corneal opacity (CO)\nCornea gradually loses its transparency, leading to visual impairment and blindness.\nTreatment\nStages 1 and 2:\nClean eyes and face several times per day.\nAntibiotic treatment [3] :\nThe treatment of choice is azithromycin PO:\nChildren: 20 mg/kg single dose\nAdults: 1 g single dose\nFailing the above, 1% tetracycline eye ointment: one application 2 times daily for 6 weeks, or, as a last resort,\nerythromycin PO: 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily for 14 days.\nStage 3: no treatment\nStage 4: surgical treatment\nWhile waiting for surgery, if regular patient follow-up is possible, taping eyelashes to the eyelid is a palliative\nmeasure that can help protect the cornea. In certain cases, this may lead to permanent correction of the trichiasis\nwithin a few months.\nThe method consists in sticking the ingrowing eyelashes to the external eyelid with a thin strip of sticking-plaster,\nmaking sure that the eyelid can open and close perfectly. Replace the plaster when it starts to peel off (usually once\na week); continue treatment for 3 months.\nPage 17 1/ 409\nNote: epilation of ingrowing eyelashes is not recommended since it offers only temporary relief and regrowing\neyelashes are more abrasive to the cornea.\nStage 5: no treatment\nPrevention\nCleaning of the eyes, face and hands with clean water reduces direct transmission and the development of secondary\nbacterial infections.\nReferences\n1.

It arises principally following trauma\nto the eyelids (insect bite or abrasion).\nOrbital cellulitis is a serious infection involving the contents of the orbit (fat and ocular muscles) that may lead to loss of\nvision or a brain abscess. It usually arises secondary to spread from sinusitis (e.g. as a complication of ethmoid\nsinusitis).\nPeriorbital and orbital cellulitis are more common in children than in adults.\nThe most common organisms causing periorbital and orbital cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus\npneumoniae and other streptococci, as well as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in children living in countries where\nrates of immunisation with Hib remain low.\nClinical features\nSigns common to both periorbital and orbital cellulitis: acute eyelid erythema and oedema; the oedema has a\nviolaceous hue if secondary to H. influenzae.\nIn case of orbital cellulitis only:\nPain with eye movements;\nOphthalmoplegia (paralysis of eye movements) often with diplopia (double vision);\nProtrusion of the eye (eye bulges out of the socket);\nHigh fever, systemic signs.\nTreatment\nHospitalize for the following: orbital cellulitis, children younger than 3 months, critically ill appearing patient a , local\ncomplications, debilitated patient (chronic conditions, the elderly), if there is a risk of non-compliance with or failure\nof outpatient treatment.

Transmission by transfusion of parasite infected blood and transplacental transmission are\nalso possible.\n5 species of Plasmodium cause malaria in humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. All\nspecies may cause uncomplicated malaria. Severe malaria (defined by the presence of complications) is almost always\ndue to P. falciparum. and, less frequently, P. vivax and P. knowlesi.\nUncomplicated malaria can rapidly progress to severe malaria, and severe malaria may cause death within a few hours\nif left untreated.\nClinical features\nMalaria should always be considered in patients living in or coming from, an endemic area, who presents with fever (or\nhistory of fever in the previous 48 hours).\nUncomplicated malaria\nFever is frequently associated with chills, sweating, headache, muscular ache, malaise, anorexia or nausea. In children,\nfever may be associated with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. Mild to moderate anaemia is frequent in children\nand pregnant women.\nSevere malaria\nIn addition to the above, patients presenting with one or more of the following complications [1] should be hospitalised\nimmediately:\nImpaired consciousness, including coma.\nSeizures: more than 2 episodes of generalised or focal (e.g. abnormal eye movements) seizures within 24 hours.\nProstration: extreme weakness; in children: inability to sit or drink/suck.\nRespiratory distress: rapid, laboured breathing or slow, deep breathing.\nShock: cold extremities, weak or absent pulse, capillary refill time \u2265 3 seconds, cyanosis.\nJaundice: yellow discolouration of mucosal surfaces of the mouth, conjunctivae and palms.\nHaemoglobinuria: dark red urine.\nAbnormal bleeding: skin (petechiae), conjunctivae, nose, gums; blood in stools.\nAcute renal failure: oliguria (urine output < 12 ml/kg/day in children and < 400 ml/day in adults) despite adequate\nhydration.\nLaboratory\nParasitological diagnosis [2]\nDiagnosis of malaria should be confirmed, whenever possible. If testing is not available, treatment of suspected malaria\nshould not be delayed.\nRapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) a\nRapid tests detect parasite antigens. They give only a qualitative result (positive or negative) and may remain positive\nseveral days or weeks following elimination of parasites.\nPage 18 1/ 409\nMicroscopy\nThin and thick blood films enable parasite detection, species identification, quantification and monitoring of\nparasitaemia.\nBlood films may be negative due to sequestration of the parasitized erythrocytes in peripheral capillaries in severe\nmalaria, as well as in placental vessels in pregnant women.\nNote: even with positive diagnostic results, rule out other causes of fever.\nAdditional examinations\nHaemoglobin (Hb) level\nTo be measured routinely in all patients with clinical anaemia, and in all patients with severe malaria.\nBlood glucose level\nTo be measured routinely to detect hypoglycaemia in patients with severe malaria and those with malnutrition (see\nHypoglycaemia, Chapter 1).\nTreatment of malaria due to P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi\nchloroquine (CQ) PO b\nChildren and adults:\nDay 1: 10 mg base/kg\nDay 2: 10 mg base/kg\nDay 3: 5 mg base/kg\nIn general P. vivax remains sensitive to CQ but resistance is found in several countries. Where such resistance is high\n(>10%), or in countries which have de-registered CQ due to P. falciparum resistance, an artemisinin-based combination\ntherapy (ACT) c should be used instead [1] . For dosing information, see Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.\nRelapses can occur with P. vivax and P. ovale due to activation of dormant parasites in the liver. Primaquine PO for 14\ndays (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg once daily in children \u2265 15 kg; 15 mg once daily in adults) can be given to eliminate these\nparasites, after the initial treatment with CQ or an ACT. However, this treatment is only recommended for patients living\nin areas where reinfection is unlikely, i.e. non-endemic, low transmission areas or in countries aiming for elimination of\nmalaria. This treatment is contra-indicated in individuals with G6PD deficiency. If G6PD deficiency cannot be tested\nindividually, the decision to prescribe primaquine must take into account the prevalence of deficiency in the population.\nTreatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria\nAntimalarial treatment\nDuring pregnancy, see Antimalarial treatment in pregnant women.\nTreatment is an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) c given by the oral route for 3 days [1] . The first-line ACT\nis chosen according to therapeutic efficacy in the area where the patient is living. If the first line ACT is unavailable,\ncontra-indicated or has failed despite being correctly administered, use another ACT. For dosing information, see table\nbelow.\nPage 18 2/ 409\nTreatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria b\nIn low malaria endemic areas, in addition to ACT, all individuals (except in children < 30 kg, pregnant women or\nbreastfeeding women of infants aged < 6 months) diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria, should be given a single dose\nof 0.25 mg/kg primaquine to reduce the risk of transmission [3] .\nNotes:\nIn infants below the age/weight mentioned in the table above, there is little data on efficacy and safety of ACTs.\nThe combinations AL, AS/AQ and DHA/PPQ can be used.

If not, continue parenteral treatment once daily until the patient can change to oral route\n(without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment).\nNote: if patient is still on parenteral treatment on Day 5, continue on the same treatment until Day 7. In this case it is\nnot necessary to start an ACT.\nQuinine IV is still recommended in some national protocols. It may be used in treatment of malaria with shock if\nartesunate IV is not available. The dose is expressed in quinine salt:\nLoading dose: 20 mg/kg to be administered over 4 hours, then, keep the vein open with an infusion of 5% glucose\nover 4 hours; then\nMaintenance dose: 8 hours after the start of the loading dose, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (alternate quinine over 4\nhours and 5% glucose over 4 hours).\nFor adults, administer each dose of quinine in 250 ml of glucose. For children under 20 kg, administer each dose of\nquinine in a volume of 10 ml/kg of glucose.\nDo not administer a loading dose to patients who have received oral quinine, or mefloquine within the previous 24\nhours: start with maintenance dose.\nTreat parenterally for at least 24 hours, then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day\ncourse of an ACT (or if not available, oral quinine to complete 7 days of quinine treatment).

For more information, refer to\nthe guide Public health engineering, MSF.\nSee specialised literature for information regarding anti-vector measures and prevention in travellers.\nFootnotes\n(a) Most rapid tests detect the following antigens alone or in combination: HRP2 protein specific to P. falciparum; an enzyme\n(Pf pLDH) specific to P. falciparum; an enzyme (pan pLDH) common to all 4 plasmodium species. HRP2 may continue to be\ndetectable for 6 weeks or more after parasite clearance; pLDH remains detectable for several days (up to 2 weeks) after\nparasite clearance.\nUse pan pLDH tests as first choice in hyper and holo-endemic areas, as well as in areas of intense seasonal transmission and\nduring outbreaks or complex emergencies. In other contexts, HRP2 tests (P. falciparum > 95%) or HRP2 + pLDH combination\ntests (P. falciparum < 95%) are preferred.\n(b) If the patient vomits within 30 minutes after administration: re-administer the full dose. If the patient vomits between 30\nminutes and 1 hour after administration, re-administer half of the dose. If severe vomiting precludes oral therapy, manage as\nsevere malaria, see Treatment of severe malaria.\nPage 18 6/ 409\n(c) ACT: a combination of artemisinin or one of its derivatives (e.g. artesunate, artemether) with another antimalarial of a\ndifferent class.\n(d) If it is impossible to refer a patient to a center capable of providing parenteral treatment, rectal artesunate should be given\naccording to the same schedule as artesunate slow IV injection (H0, H12, H24, then once daily).\n(e) Place a level teaspoon of sugar, moistened with a few drops of water, under the tongue, then place the patient in the\nrecovery position. Repeat after 15 minutes if the patient has not regained consciousness. As with other methods for\ntreating hypoglycaemia, maintain regular sugar intake, and monitor.\nReferences\n1.

Transmission by contaminated blood transfusion and transplacental\ntransmission are also possible.\nThe disease is found only in sub-Saharan Africa. There are two forms: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense HAT in western\nand central Africa and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense HAT in eastern and southern Africa.\nClinical features\nInoculation may be followed by an immediate local reaction (trypanosomal chancre). This chancre arises in about 50%\nof all rhodesiense but rarely in gambiense.\nGambiense HAT\nIncubation lasts from a few days to several years.\nThe first stage (haemolymphatic stage) corresponds to the haematogenous and lymphatic dissemination of the\nparasite. Signs include intermittent fever, joint pain, lymphadenopathy (firm, mobile, painless lymph nodes, mainly\ncervical), hepatosplenomegaly and skin signs (facial oedema, pruritus).\nThe second stage (meningoencephalitic stage) corresponds to the invasion of the central nervous system. Signs of\nthe haemolymphatic stage recede or disappear and varying neurological signs progressively develop: sensory\ndisturbances (deep hyperaesthesia), psychiatric disorders (apathy or agitation), disturbance of the sleep cycle (with\ndaytime somnolence alternating with insomnia at night), impaired motor functions (paralysis, seizures, tics) and\nneuroendocrine disorders (amenorrhoea, impotence).\nIn the absence of treatment: cachexia, lethargy, coma and death.\nRhodesiense HAT\nThe first stage is the same as above, but the incubation period is shorter (< 3 weeks), the disease evolves more rapidly\nand symptoms are more severe. Patients often die of myocarditis in 3 to 6 months without having developed signs of\nthe meningo-encephalitic stage.\nIn practice, gambiense and rhodesiense HAT can be difficult to differentiate: e.g., there exist cases of acute\ngambiense infection and others of chronic rhodesiense infection.\nLaboratory\nDiagnosis involves 3 steps for gambiense HAT (screening test, diagnostic confirmation and stage determination)\nand 2 steps for rhodesiense HAT (diagnostic confirmation and stage determination).\nThe recommended screening test for T.b. gambiense infection is the CATT (Card Agglutination Test for\nTrypanosomiasis). It detects the presence of specific antibodies in the patient\u2019s blood or serum.\nDiagnostic confirmation: presence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirates or in blood using concentration\ntechniques: capillary tube centrifugation technique (Woo test), quantitative buffy coat (QBC), mini-anion exchange\ncentrifugation technique (mAEC).\nStage determination: detection of trypanosomes (after centrifugation) and white cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid\n(lumbar puncture):\nHaemolymphatic stage: no trypanosomes AND \u2264 5 white cells/mm3\nPage 18 8/ 409\nMeningoencephalitic stage: evidence of trypanosomes OR > 5 white cells/mm3\nTreatment (except in pregnant women)\nDue to the toxicity of trypanocides, detection of the parasite is essential before initiating treatment. In the absence\nof parasitological confirmation, treatment may nevertheless be justified in certain cases: very strong clinical\nsuspicion, patients in life-threatening condition, strong serological suspicion (CATT 1:16 positive) in a population\nwhere the disease is highly prevalent (> 2%).\nSeveral treatment regimens exist. Check national recommendations and local resistance levels.\nTreatment must be administered under close medical supervision. Patients receiving pentamidine can be treated as\noutpatients but those receiving suramin, eflornithine (with or without nifurtimox) or melarsoprol should be\nhospitalised.\nAfter treatment, patients should be checked every 6 months (clinical examination, lumbar puncture and examination\nfor trypanosomes) over 24 months, to look for relapse.\nHaemolymphatic stage (Stage I)\nGambiense HAT\npentamidine isetionate deep IM\nChildren and adults: 4 mg/kg once daily for 7 to 10 days\nPatients should receive a source of glucose (meal, sweet tea) one hour before injection (risk of hypoglycaemia); they\nshould remain supine during administration and one hour after injection (risk of hypotension).\nRhodesiense HAT\nsuramin slow IV\nChildren and adults:\nD1: test dose of 4 to 5 mg/kg\nD3, D10, D17, D24, D31: 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g per injection)\nSuramin may cause anaphylactic reactions, a test dose is recommended prior to starting treatment. In the event of an\nanaphylactic reaction after the test dose, the patients must not be given suramin again.\nMeningoencephalitic stage (Stage II)\nBefore administrating trypanocides, the priority is to improve the patient\u2019s general condition (rehydration, treatment of\nmalaria, intestinal worms, malnutrition, bacterial infections). It is nonetheless recommended not to postpone the\ntrypanocidal treatment for more than 10 days.\nGambiense HAT\nFirst choice: nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT)\nnifurtimox PO\nChildren and adults: 5 mg/kg 3 times daily for 10 days\n+ eflornithine IV infusion over 2 hours\nChildren and adults: 200 mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days\nThe catheter must be handled with great attention to avoid local or general bacterial infections: thoroughly disinfect\nthe insertion site, ensure secure catheter fixation, protect the insertion site with a sterile dressing, systematically\nchange the catheter every 48 hours or earlier in case of signs of phlebitis.\nSecond choice:\neflornithine IV infusion over 2 hours\nPage 18 9/ 409\nChildren under 12 years: 150 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: 100 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days\nIn the event of a relapse after NECT or eflornithine:\nmelarsoprol slow IV\nChildren and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days\nMelarsoprol is highly toxic: reactive encephalopathy (coma, or recurrent or prolonged seizures) in 5 to 10% of\ntreated patients, fatal in around 50% of cases; peripheral neuropathy, invasive diarrhoea, severe skin rash, phlebitis,\netc.\nPrednisolone PO (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment.\nRhodesiense HAT\nmelarsoprol slow IV\nChildren and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days\nPrednisolone PO (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment.\nTreatment in pregnant women\nAll trypanocides are potentially toxic for the mother and the foetus (risk of miscarriage, malformation, etc.). However,\ndue to the life-threatening risk for the mother and the risk of mother-to-child transmission, treatment must be initiated\nas follows:\nHaemolymphatic stage:\npentamidine for gambiense HAT as of the second trimester and suramin for rhodesiense HAT.\nMeningoencephalitic stage: treatment depends on the mother's condition:\nIf in immediately life-threatening condition: treatment with NECT or eflornithine cannot be deferred until after\ndelivery.\nIf not immediately life-threatening condition: pentamidine for gambiense HAT and suramin for rhodesiense HAT.\nTreatment with NECT or eflornithine is to be administered after delivery.\nPrevention and control\nIndividual protection against tsetse fly bites: long sleeves and trousers, repellents, keeping away from risk areas\n(e.g. near rivers).\nDisease control: mass screening and treatment of patients (T.b. gambiense), trypanocide treatment of cattle (T.b.\nrhodesiense), vector control using tsetse fly traps or insecticides.\nPage 19 0/ 409\nAmerican trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)\nChagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. It is transmitted to humans by contact of\ntriatomine bug faeces with a break in the skin (often caused by a bite from the triatomine bug), or with mucous\nmembranes. Transmission by contaminated blood transfusion, accidental exposure to blood, mother-to-child (during\npregnancy or childbirth) or consumption of contaminated food and water is also possible.\nChagas disease has two phases: an acute phase, which lasts approximately 4 to 6 weeks, and a chronic phase, which\nis lifelong if left untreated.\nThe disease is primarily found on the American continent a . It is significantly underdiagnosed. [1]\nClinical features\nAcute phase\nMost cases are asymptomatic.\nIf transmitted through a break in the skin: a red swelling on the skin (chagoma) or unilateral painless purplish\nperiorbital oedema (Roma\u00f1a's sign) with local lymphadenopathy, headache and fever.\nRarely: multiple lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, myocarditis (chest pain, dyspnoea), meningoencephalitis\n(seizures, paralysis).\nChronic phase\nMany cases remain asymptomatic (indeterminate phase).\nUp to 30% of cases develop organ damage: [2]\ncardiac lesions (conduction disorders, dilated cardiomyopathy): arrhythmia, dyspnoea, chest pain, heart failure;\ngastrointestinal lesions (dilation of the oesophagus or colon i.e. megaoesophagus, megacolon): difficulty\nswallowing, severe constipation.\nIndividuals with immunosuppression have a higher risk of developing organ damage than the general population.\nDiagnosis\nLaboratory [1]\nAcute phase:\nIdentification of Trypanosoma cruzi by direct microscopy of fresh blood or blood concentrated by\nmicrohematocrit method.\nIn case of strong clinical suspicion despite no definitive diagnosis from direct microscopy, perform serologic\ntests after a delay of approximately 1 month (see \"Chronic phase\").\nChronic phase:\nIdentification of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies by serologic tests, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or rapid diagnostic test (RDT).\nFor a definitive diagnosis, two different serological tests should be performed simultaneously; in case of\nconflicting results, a third test is recommended. b\nOther investigations\nECG may demonstrate conduction disorders.\nChest or abdominal x-ray may demonstrate cardiomegaly, megaoesophagus or megacolon.\nTreatment\nPage 19 1/ 409\nAetiologic treatment\nAcute or chronic Chagas disease can be treated with either benznidazole or nifurtimox. However, treatment is not\nrecommended if patient has already developed cardiac or digestive complications.\nClose clinical monitoring should be provided due to the frequent occurrence of adverse effects. Where available,\nblood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function tests) should be performed before, during and after\ntreatment.\nProtocols vary according to the country, follow national recommendations.\nFor information:\nAge Dose and duration\n2 to 12 years [3] 5 to 8 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses for 60 days\nbenznidazole\n(a)\nPO(\n> 12 years and adults [4] 5 to 7 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses for 60 days\n\u2264 10 years 15 to 20 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days\nnifurtimox\n11 to 16 years 12.5 to 15 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days\nPO (b) [3]\n\u2265 17 years and adults 8 to 10 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days\n(a) Benznidazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding and in patient with severe hepatic/renal impairment.\n(b) Nifurtimox is contra-indicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, patients with severe hepatic/renal impairment or history of\nsevere mental disorders or seizures.

Over 20 species cause disease in man.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in more than 70 countries in South and Central America, Middle East, Central\nAsia, and Africa.\nMucocutaneous leishmaniasis occurs in Latin America and, more rarely, in Africa (Ethiopia, Sudan).\nVisceral leishmaniasis occurs in more than 60 countries in East and North Africa, South and Central Asia, Southern\nEurope, and South and Central America.\nClinical features\nCutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis\nSingle or multiple lesions on the uncovered parts of the body: an erythematous papule begins at the sandfly bite,\nenlarges to a nodule and extends in surface and depth to form a scabbed ulcer. Ulcers are painless, unless there is\nsecondary bacterial or fungal infection.\nUsually, lesions heal spontaneously, leaving a scar, and result in lifelong protection from disease.\nLesions may also spread to the mucosa (mouth, nose, conjunctiva) giving rise to the mucocutaneous form, which\nmay cause severe disfigurement.\nVisceral leishmaniasis\nVisceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) is a systemic disease, resulting in pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and death if left\nuntreated.\nProlonged (> 2 weeks) irregular fever, splenomegaly, and weight loss are the main signs.\nOther signs include: anaemia, diarrhoea, epistaxis, lymphadenopathy, moderate hepatomegaly.\nBacterial diarrhoea, pneumonia, and tuberculosis may develop due to immunosuppression.\nPost-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis\nMacular, nodular or papular skin rash of unknown aetiology, particularly on the face, and typically occurring after\napparent cure of visceral leishmaniasis.\nLaboratory\nCutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis\nParasitological diagnosis: identification of Giemsa-stained parasites in smears of tissue biopsy from the edge of\nthe ulcer.\nNo useful serological tests.\nVisceral leishmaniasis\nParasitological diagnosis: identification of Giemsa-stained parasites in smears of splenic, bone marrow, or lymph\nnode aspiration-biopsy. Splenic aspiration is the most sensitive technique but carries a theoretical risk of potentially\nfatal haemorrhage.\nSerological diagnosis: rK39 dipstick test and direct agglutination test (DAT) can be used for diagnosis of primary\nvisceral leishmaniasis in clinically suspect cases. Diagnosis of relapse is only by parasitological confirmation.\nPage 19 4/ 409\nTreatment\nThe various species of Leishmania respond differently to drugs. Follow national recommendations.\nFor information:\nCutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis\nCutaneous lesions generally heal spontaneously in 3 to 6 months. Treatment is only indicated if lesions are\npersistent (> 6 months), disfiguring, ulcerating, or disseminated.\nForms with a single lesion or few lesions: start with local treatment with a pentavalent antimonial: sodium\nstibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate, 1 to 2 ml infiltrated into the lesion if it is a nodule and into the edges\nand base around the crust if it is an ulcer.\nIt should be repeated every 3 to 7 days for 2 to 4 weeks. Once healing begins, the treatment can be stopped and\nhealing will continue.\nIM treatment with a pentavalant antimonial (20 mg/kg daily for 10 to 20 days) is restricted to severe cases and must\nbe administered under close medical supervision.\nMiltefosine PO (as for visceral leishmaniasis) for 28 days is effective in many forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nUlcers are often secondarily infected with streptococci and staphylococci: administer suitable antibiotics.\nMucocutaneous forms: as for visceral leishmaniasis.\nVisceral leishmaniasis\nVisceral leishmaniasis in East Africa\nFirst-line treatment:\na pentavalent antimonial IM or slow IV: 20 mg/kg daily for 17 days\n+ paromomycin IM: 15 mg (11 mg base)/kg daily for 17 days\nSecond-line treatment for relapse and for specific vulnerable groups: severe disease, pregnant women, patients\nover 45 years:\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 6 to 10 days up to a total dose of 30 mg/kg\nTreatment in HIV co-infected patients:\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 6 to 10 days up to a total dose of 30 mg/kg\n+ miltefosine PO for 28 days:\nChildren 2 to 11 years: 2.5 mg/kg once daily\nChildren \u2265 12 years and < 25 kg: 50 mg once daily\nChildren \u2265 12 years and adults 25 to 50 kg: 50 mg 2 times daily\nAdults > 50 kg: 50 mg 3 times daily\nVisceral leishmaniasis in South Asia\nFirst-line treatment:\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 3 to 5 days up to a total dose of 15 mg/kg\nor\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 10 mg/kg single dose\nSecond-line treatment for relapse:\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 5 to 8 days up to a total dose of 25 mg/kg\nFor all patients with visceral leishmaniasis, hydration, nutritional support and treatment of intercurrent infections\n(malaria, dysentery, pneumonia, etc.) are essential.\nTuberculosis and/or HIV infection may also be present and should be suspected if relapse occurs more than once or in\nthe event of treatment failure.\nPage 19 5/ 409\nPost-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)\nOnly patients with severe or disfiguring disease or with lesions remaining for > 6 months, and young children with oral\nlesions that interfere with feeding, are treated.\nPKDL in East Africa\na pentavalent antimonial IM or slow IV: 20 mg/kg daily for 17 to 60 days\n+ paromomycin IM: 15 mg (11 mg base)/kg daily for 17 days\nor\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 2.5 mg/kg once daily for 20 days\nor\nmiltefosine PO for 28 days (as for visceral leishmaniasis) may be beneficial in HIV co-infected patients\nPKDL in South Asia\nliposomal amphotericin B IV infusion: 5 mg/kg 2 times weekly up to a total dose of 30 mg/kg\nPrevention\nInsecticide-treated mosquito nets.\nVector control and elimination of animal reservoir hosts.\nPage 19 6/ 409\nIntestinal protozoan infections (parasitic\ndiarrhoea)\nThe most important intestinal protozoan infections are amoebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica), giardiasis (Giardia\nlamblia), cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium sp), cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora cayetanensis) and isosporiasis (Isospora\nbelli).\nIntestinal protozoa are transmitted by the faecal-oral route (soiled hands, ingestion of food or water contaminated\nwith faeces) and may cause both individual cases of diarrhoea and epidemic diarrhoea outbreaks.\nClinical features\nAmoebiasis gives rise to bloody diarrhoea (see Amoebiasis, Chapter 3).\nClinical presentation of giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis and isosporiasis is very similar:\nDiarrhoea is usually mild and self-limiting, except in children and patients with advanced HIV disease (CD4 < 200).\nThese patients are likely to develop severe, intermittent or chronic diarrhoea that may be complicated by\nmalabsorption with significant wasting (or failure to gain weight in children) or severe dehydration.\nStools are usually watery, but steatorrhoea (pale, bulky, fatty stools) may be found in the event of secondary fat\nmalabsorption; stools may contain mucus.\nDiarrhoea is usually associated with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal distension and cramps,\nflatulence, nausea, anorexia), but patients have low-grade fever or no fever.\nLaboratory\nDefinitive diagnosis relies on parasite identification in stool specimens (trophozoites and cysts for giardia; oocysts for\ncryptosporidium, cyclospora, isospora). Two to three samples, collected 2 to 3 days apart are necessary, as\npathogens are shed intermittently.\nTreatment\nCorrect dehydration if present (for clinical features and management, see Dehydration, Chapter 1).\nIf the causal agent has been identified in the stool:\nPage 19 7/ 409\nGiardiasis tinidazole PO single dose\nChildren: 50 mg/kg (max. 2 g)\nAdults: 2 g\nor\nmetronidazole PO for 3 days\nChildren: 30 mg/kg once daily\nAdults: 2 g once daily\nCryptosporidiosis In immunocompetent patients, no aetiological treatment; spontaneous\nresolution in 1 to 2 weeks.\nCyclosporiasis co-trimoxazole PO for 7 days\nChildren: 25 mg SMX + 5 mg TMP/kg 2 times daily\nAdults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP 2 times daily\nIn immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 1 to 3\nweeks. Treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms.\nIsoporiasis co-trimoxazole PO for 7 to 10 days\nAdults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP 2 times daily\nIn immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 2 to 3\nweeks. Treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms.\nIf reliable stool examination cannot be carried out: parasitic diarrhoeas cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds,\nnor is it possible to distinguish these from non- parasitic diarrhoeas. An empirical treatment (using tinidazole or\nmetronidazole and co-trimoxazole as above, together or in succession) may be tried in the case of prolonged\ndiarrhoea or steatorrhoea. In patients with HIV infection, see empirical treatment (HIV infections and AIDS, Chapter\n8).\nIn patients with advanced HIV disease, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis and isosporiasis are opportunistic\ninfections; the most effective intervention is the treatment of the underlying HIV infection with antiretrovirals.\nPatients remain at high risk for dehydration/death until immunity is restored.\nPage 19 8/ 409\nFlukes\nPage 19 9/ 409\nInfection/Epidemiology Clinical features/Diagnosis Treatment\nLung flukes The two most prominent symptoms are prolonged (> 2 weeks) praziquantel\nParagonimus sp productive cough and intermittent haemoptysis (rusty-brown sputum).

The\nthree main species infecting humans are Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma\njaponicum. Schistosoma mekongi and Schistosoma intercalatum have a more limited distribution.\nHumans are infected while wading/bathing in fresh water infested with schistosome larvae. Symptoms occurring during\nthe phases of parasite invasion (transient localized itching as larvae penetrate the skin) and migration (allergic\nmanifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms during migration of schistosomules) are frequently overlooked. In\ngeneral, schistosomiasis is suspected when symptoms of established infection become evident. Each species gives\nrise to a specific clinical form: genito-urinary schistosomiasis due to S. haematobium, intestinal schistosomiasis due S.\nmansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum.\nThe severity of the disease depends on the parasite load. Heavily infected patients are prone to visceral lesions with\npotentially irreversible sequelae. Children aged 5 to 15 years are particularly at risk: prevalence and parasite load are\nhighest in this age group.\nAn antiparasitic treatment should be administered to reduce the risk of severe lesions, even if there is a likelihood of re-\ninfection.\nClinical features\nPage 20 2/ 409\nClinical features/Diagnosis\nParasite/Epidemiology a\n(established infection)\nGenito-urinary S. haematobium Urinary manifestations:\nschistosomiasis Distribution: Africa, In endemic areas, urinary schistosomiasis should be\nMadagascar and the suspected in any patients who complain of macroscopic\nArabian peninsula haematuria (red coloured urine throughout, or at the end of,\nmicturition).

Human to human transmission takes\nplace through the bite of an insect vector.\nThe most important pathogens are outlined in the table below. Mixed infections are common in co-endemic regions.\nEach filarial species is found in 2 principal developmental stages: macrofilariae (adult worms) and microfilariae (larval\noffspring). The treatment depends on the pathogenic stage of the species considered and targets microfilariae for O.\nvolvulus and macrofilariae for the other species.\nLocation of Location of Pathogenic Presence\nSpecies/Infections\nmacrofilariae microfilariae stage of Wolbachia\nOnchocerca volvulus Subcutaneous\nSkin and eye Microfilariae Yes\n(onchocerciasis) nodules\nLoa loa Subcutaneous\nBlood Macrofilariae No\n(loiasis) tissue\nWuchereria bancrofti, Brugia\nmalayi and Brugia timori Lymph vessels Blood Macrofilariae Yes\n(lymphatic filariasis)\nClassical antifilarial agents include diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin and albendazole. Doxycycline is used solely in\nthe treatment of O. volvulus and lymphatic filarial worms, which harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium (Wolbachia)\nsensitive to doxycycline.\nPage 21 1/ 409\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness)\nThe distribution of onchocerciasis is linked to that of its vector (Simulium), which reproduces near rapidly flowing rivers\nin intertropical Africa (99% of cases), Latin America (Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil) and\nYemen.\nClinical features\nIn endemic areas, the following signs, alone or in combination, are suggestive of onchocerciasis:\nOnchocercomas: painless subcutaneous nodules containing adult worms, usually found over a bony prominence\n(iliac crest, trochanters, sacrum, rib cage, skull, etc.), measuring several mm or cm in size, firm, smooth, round or\noval, mobile or adherent to underlying tissue; single, or multiple and clustered.\nAcute papular onchodermatitis: papular rash, sometimes diffuse but often confined to the buttocks or lower\nextremities, intensely itchy, associated with scratch marks, often superinfected (\u201cfilarial scabies\u201d) a . This arises from\ndermal invasion by microfilariae.\nLate chronic skin lesions: patchy depigmentation on the shins (\u201cleopard skin\u201d), skin atrophy or areas of dry,\nthickened, peeling skin (lichenification; \u201clizard skin\u201d).\nVisual disturbances and ocular lesions: see Onchocerciasis, Chapter 5.\nLaboratory\nDetection of the microfilariae in the skin (skin snip biopsy, iliac crest).\nIf the skin biopsy is positive, look for loiasis in regions where loiasis is co-endemic (mainly in Central Africa).\nTreatment\nAntiparasitic treatment\nDiethylcarbamazine is contra-indicated (risk of severe ocular lesions).\nDoxycycline PO (200 mg once daily for 4 weeks; if possible 6 weeks) kills a significant percentage of adult worms\nand progressively reduces the number of O. volvulus microfilariae b . It is contraindicated in children < 8 years and\npregnant or breast-feeding women.\nIvermectin PO is the drug of choice: 150 micrograms/kg single dose; a 2nd dose should be administered after 3\nmonths if clinical signs persist. Repeat the treatment every 6 or 12 months to maintain the parasite load below the\nthreshold at which clinical signs appear c . Ivermectin is not recommended in children < 5 years or < 15 kg and\npregnant women.\nIn case of co-infection with Loa loa or in regions where loiasis is co-endemic, ivermectin should be administered\nwith caution (risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high L. loa microfilarial load):\nIf it is possible to test for Loa loa (thick blood film):\nConfirm and quantify the microfilaraemia. Administer the appropriate treatment according to the microfilarial\nload (see Loiasis).\nIf it is not possible to perform a thick film examination, take a history from the patient:\nIf the patient has received a previous treatment with ivermectin without developing serious adverse reactions\n(see Loiasis), administer the treatment.\nIf the patient has never received ivermectin nor developed signs of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the\nconjunctiva, or \u00ab Calabar \u00bb swellings), administer the treatment.\nIf the patient already has developed signs of loiaisis and if onchocerciasis has a significant clinical impact,\nadminister ivermectin under close supervision (see Loiasis) or use an alternative (doxycycline, as above).\nPage 21 2/ 409\nIn the case of concomitant lymphatic filariasis: administer ivermectin first then start treatment for lymphatic\nfilariasis with doxycycline PO (see Lymphatic filariasis) one week later.\nNodulectomy (surgical removal of onchocercomas)\nNodules are benign, often deep, and their ablation does not treat onchocerciasis. Thus, nodulectomy is reserved for\ncranial nodules (their proximity to the eye is a risk factor for visual compromise) or nodules which are cosmetically\nunacceptable. In other cases, refrain from nodulectomy. Nodulectomy is performed under local anaesthesia, in an\nappropriately equipped facility.\nFootnotes\n(a) Differential diagnosis is sarcoptic scabies (Scabies, Chapter 4).\n(b) Elimination of Wolbachia reduces the longevity and fertility of the macrofilariae, and thus the production of new microfilariae\nwithin the organism.\n(c) Ivermectin kills microfilariae and disrupts production of microfilariae by adult worms. However the treatment must be\nadministered at regular intervals since it does not kill adult worms.\nPage 21 3/ 409\nLoiasis\nThe distribution of loiasis is linked to that of its vector (Chrysops) in forests or savannah with gallery forests in West or\nCentral Africa (limits West: Benin; East: Uganda; North: Sudan and South: Angola).\nClinical features\nThe subconjunctival migration of an adult worm is pathognomonic of Loa loa infection.\nLocalised subcutaneous swellings, allergic in origin, transient (several hours or days), painless, non-pitting, appearing\nanywhere on the body, frequently the upper extremities and face, often associated with localised or generalised\npruritus (\u00ab Calabar swellings \u00bb).\nOnset of pruritus, in the absence of other signs.\nSubcutaneous migration of an adult worm: pruritic, palpable red cord-like linear lesion, sinuous, advancing (1\ncm/hour), disappearing rapidly with no trace a . Such migration generally arises following treatment with\ndiethylcarbamazine, rarely spontaneously.\nLaboratory\nDetection of microfilariae in the peripheral blood (thick film, stained with Giemsa). Blood specimens should be\ncollected between 10 am and 5 pm. Quantify microfilaraemia even if the diagnosis is certain, since treatment is\ndetermined by the intensity of the parasite load.\nIf the thick film is positive, look for onchocerciasis in regions where onchocerciasis is coendemic (mainly in Central\nAfrica).\nTreatment\nAntiparasitic treatment\nDiethylcarbamazine (DEC) is the only macrofilaricide available but is contra-indicated in:\nPatients with microfilaraemia > 2000 mf/ml (risk of severe encephalopathy, with poor prognosis).\nPatients co-infected with O. volvulus (risk of severe eye lesions).\nPregnant women, infants, and patients in poor general condition.\nIvermectin (and possibly albendazole) is used to reduce microfilaraemia before administration of DEC; however,\nivermectin administration may trigger encephalopathy in patients with very high Loa loa microfilaraemia (> 30 000\nmf/ml).\nDoxycycline is not indicated since Loa loa does not harbour Wolbachia.\nManagement:\n1) L. loa microfilaraemia is < 1,000-2,000 mf/ml\nA 28-day treatment of DEC may be started using a small dose: 6 mg on D1, i.e. 1/8 of a 50 mg tablet 2 times\ndaily.\nDouble the dose every day up to 200 mg 2 times daily in adults (1.5 mg/kg 2 times daily in children).\nIf microfilaraemia or symptoms persist, a second treatment is given 4 weeks later.\nIf DEC is contra-indicated due to possible or confirmed co-infection with O. volvulus, ivermectin (150\nmicrogams/kg single dose) treats onchocerciasis, and reduces pruritus and frequency of Calabar swellings.\nThe treatment may be repeated every month or every 3 months.\nPage 21 4/ 409\n2) L. loa microfilaraemia is between 2,000 and 8,000 mf/ml\nReduce microfilaraemia with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose); repeat the treatment every month if\nnecessary; administer DEC when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml.\n3) L. loa microfilaraemia is between 8,000 and 30,000 mf/ml\nTreatment with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) may cause marked functional impairment for\nseveral days. Close supervision and support from family member(s) are necessary b . Prescribe paracetamol as\nwell for 7 days.\n4) L. loa microfilaraemia is > 30,000 mf/ml\nIf the loiasis is well tolerated, it is preferable to refrain from treatment: the disease is benign and treatment\nwith ivermectin may cause very severe adverse reactions (encephalopathy), albeit rarely.\nIf loiasis has a significant clinical impact and/or the patient presents with symptomatic onchocerciasis\nrequiring treatment, ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) is administered for 5 days under supervision\nin hospital c . An attempt to first reduce L. loa microfilaraemia using albendazole (200 mg 2 times daily for 3\nweeks) is an option. When L. loa microfilaraemia is < 30 000 mf/ml, treat with ivermectin under close\nsupervision and support, then DEC when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml.\nExtraction of macrofilariae\nSubcutaneous migration of a microfilaria usually results from treatment with DEC; the worm will die beneath the skin\nand extracting it serves no purpose.\nRemoval of an adult worm from the conjunctiva: see Loasis, Chapter 5.\nFootnotes\n(a) For differential diagnosis, see cutaneous larva migrans.\n(b) Patients may present with various pain syndromes, be unable to move without help or unable to move at all. Monitoring is\nnecessary to determine whether the patient can manage activities of daily living, and provide assistance if necessary. If the\npatient remains bedridden for several days, ensure pressure sores do not develop (mobilisation, repositioning).\n(c) A severe reaction may occur on D2-D3. It is usually preceded by haemorrhages of the palpebral conjunctiva on D1-D2.\nRoutinely check for this sign by turning back the eyelids. Symptoms of post ivermectin encephalopathy are reversible and\nthe prognosis favourable, if the patient is correctly managed; the treatment is symptomatic until symptoms resolve. Avoid\nthe use of steroids due to adverse effects.\nPage 21 5/ 409\nLymphatic filariasis (LF)\nThe distribution of LF is linked to that of its mosquito vectors (Anopheles, Culex, Aedes, etc.):\nW. bancrofti: sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Egypt, India, South East Asia, Pacific region, South America, The\nCaribbean\nB. malayi: South East Asia, China, India, Sri Lanka\nB. timori: Timor\n90% of LF is due to W. bancrofti and 10% to Brugia spp.\nClinical features\nAcute recurrent inflammatory manifestations\nAdenolymphangitis: lymph node(s) and red, warm, tender oedema along the length of a lymphatic channel, with or\nwithout systemic signs (e.g. fever, nausea, vomiting). The inflammation may involve the lower limbs, external\ngenitalia and breast.\nIn men: acute inflammation of the spermatic cord (funiculitis), epididymis and testicle (epididymo-orchitis).\nAttacks resolve spontaneously within a week and recur regularly in patients with chronic disease.\nChronic manifestations\nLymphoedema: oedema of the lower extremity or external genitalia or breast, secondary to obstruction of the\nlymphatics by macrofilariae. The oedema is reversible initially but then becomes chronic and increasingly severe:\nhypertrophy of the area affected, progressive thickening of the skin (fibrous thickening with formation of\ncreases, initially superficial, but then deep, and verrucous lesions). The final stage of lymphoedema is\nelephantiasis.\nIn men: increase in volume of fluid due to accumulation within the tunica vaginalis (hydrocoele, lymphocoele,\nchylocoele); chronic epididymo-orchitis.\nChyluria: milky or rice-water urine (disruption of a lymphatic vessel in the urinary tract).\nIn patients parasitized by Brugia spp, genital lesions and chyluria are rare: lymphoedema is usually confined to\nbelow the knee.\nLaboratory\nDetection of microfilariae in the peripheral blood (thick film) a ; blood specimens should be collected between 9 pm\nand 3 am.\nIn regions where loiasis and/or onchocerciasis are co-endemic, check for co-infection if the LF diagnosis is\npositive.\nTreatment\nAntiparasitic treatment\nTreatment is not administered during an acute attack.\nDoxycycline PO, when administered as a prolonged treatment, eliminates the majority of macrofilariae and reduces\nlymphoedema: 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks minimum. It is contraindicated in children < 8 years and pregnant or\nbreast-feeding women.\nDiethylcarbamazine PO single dose (400 mg in adults; 3 mg/kg in children) may be an alternative but eliminates a\nvariable proportion of adult worms (up to 40%) and does not relieve symptoms; a prolonged treatment is no more\neffective than single dose therapy. In addition, DEC is contra-indicated in patients with onchocerciasis or Loa\nloa microfilarial load > 2000 mf/ml and in pregnant and breast-feeding women.\nPage 21 6/ 409\nIvermectin (weak or absent macrofilaricidal effect) and albendazole should not be used for the treatment of\nindividual cases (no effect on symptoms).\nIn the case of confirmed or probable co-infection with O. volvulus: treat onchocerciasis first, then administer\ndoxycycline.\nControl/prevention of inflammatory manifestations and infectious complications\nAcute attacks: bed rest, elevation of the affected limb without bandaging, cooling of the affected limb (wet cloth,\ncold bath) and analgesics; antibacterial or antifungal cream if necessary; antipyretics if fever (paracetamol) and\nhydration.\nPrevention of episodes of lymphangitis and lymphoedema: hygiene of the affected extremity b , comfortable\nfootwear, immediate attention to secondary bacterial/fungal infections and wounds.\nEstablished lymphoedema: bandaging of the affected limb by day, elevation of the affected extremity (after\nremoval of the bandage) when at rest, simple exercises (flexion-extension of the feet when recumbent or upright,\nrotation of the ankles); skin hygiene, as above.\nSurgery\nMay be indicated in the treatment of chronic manifestations: advanced lymphoedema (diversion-reconstruction),\nhydrocoele and its complications, chyluria.\nFootnotes\n(a) When test results are negative in a clinically suspect case, consider detection of antigens (ICT rapid test) and/or ultrasound\nof the inguinal area in search of the \u00ab filarial dance sign \u00bb.\n(b) Wash at least once daily (soap and water at room temperature), paying special attention to folds and interdigital areas;\nrinse thoroughly and dry with a clean cloth; nail care.\nPage 21 7/ 409\nChapter 7: Bacterial diseases\nBacterial meningitis\nTetanus\nEnteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fevers\nBrucellosis\nPlague\nLeptospirosis\nRelapsing fever (borreliosis)\nLouse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)\nTick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)\nEruptive rickettsioses\nPage 21 8/ 409\nBacterial meningitis\nMeningitis is an acute bacterial infection of the meninges, which may affect the brain and lead to irreversible\nneurological damage and auditory impairment.\nBacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. The treatment is based on early parenteral administration of antibiotics\nthat penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Empiric antibiotic therapy is administered if the pathogen cannot\nbe identified or while waiting for laboratory results.\nThe main bacteria responsible vary depending on age and/or context:\nMeningitis in a non-epidemic context\nChildren 0 to 3 months:\nChildren \u2264 7 days: Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella spp, E. coli, S.\nmarcescens, Pseudomona spp, Salmonella spp) and group B streptococcus\nChildren > 7 days: S. pneumoniae accounts for 50% of all bacterial meningitis\nL. monocytogenes is occasionally responsible for meningitis during this period.\nChildren 3 months-5 years: S. pneumoniae, H. influenza B and N. meningitidis\nChildren > 5 years and adults: S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis\nSpecial conditions:\nImmunodepressed patients (HIV, malnourished): high percentage of Gram- negative bacilli (specially Salmonella spp)\nand also M. tuberculosis.\nSickle cell anaemia: Salmonella spp and Staphylococcus aureus are frequent causes.\nMeningitis may be related to S. aureus when associated with skin infection or skull fracture.\nMeningitis in an epidemic context\nIn the Sahelian region (but not exclusively, e.g. Rwanda, Angola, Brazil), during the dry season, epidemics of\nmeningococcal meningitis (Neisseria meningitidis A or C or W135) affect children from 6 months of age, adolescents\nand adults. In these regions, whether during epidemics or not, all the above pathogens can be found, especially in young\nchildren.\nClinical features\nThe clinical presentation depends on the patient's age.\nChildren over 1 year and adults\nFever, severe headache, photophobia, neck stiffness\nBrudzinski's sign (neck flexion in a supine patient results in involuntary flexion of the knees) and Kernig's sign\n(attempts to extend the knee from the flexed-thigh position are met with strong passive resistance).\nPetechial or ecchymotic purpura (usually in meningococcal infections)\nIn severe forms: coma, seizures, focal signs, purpura fulminans\nChildren under 1 year\nThe classic signs of meningitis are usually absent.\nThe child is irritable, appears sick with fever or hypothermia, poor feeding or vomiting.\nOther features include: seizures, apnoea, altered consciousness, bulging fontanelle (when not crying); occasionally,\nneck stiffness and purpuric rash.\nPage 21 9/ 409\nLaboratory\nLumbar puncture (LP):\nMacroscopic examination of CSF: antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately if the LP yields a turbid CSF.\nMicroscopic examination: Gram stain (but a negative examination does not exclude the diagnosis) and white\nblood cell count (WBC).\nIn an epidemic context, once the meningococcal aetiology has been confirmed, there is no need for routine LP\nfor new cases.\nWBC Other\nPressure Aspect Protein\n(leucocytes/mm3) tests\nPandy\u2013\nNormal CSF Clear < 5 \u2013\n< 40 mg/dl\n100-20 000\nmainly neutrophiles\nIn neonates: Pandy+\nBacterial meningitis ++++ Cloudy, turbid > 20 100-500 Gram stain +\nIn mg/dl\nimmunocompromised,\nthe WBC may be < 100\nNormal to 10-700\nViral meningitis Clear Pandy\u2013 \u2013\n+ mainly lymphocytes\nClear or < 500\nTB meningitis +++ Pandy+ AFB\nyellowish mainly lymphocytes\nCryptococcal < 800\n++++ Clear Pandy\u2013 India ink\nmeningitis mainly lymphocytes\nRapid test for detection of bacterial antigens.\nNote: in an endemic area, it is essential to test for severe malaria (rapid test or thin/thick films).\nTreatment in a non-epidemic context\nAntibiotic therapy\nFor the choice of antibiotic therapy and dosages according to age, see table below.\nPage 22 0/ 409\nAssociated skin infection (including umbilical\nNo associated skin infection\ncord infection)\nFirst line Alternative First line Alternative\n0 to 7 ampicillin IV ampicillin IV cloxacillin IV cloxacillin\ndays 100 mg/kg every 12 hours 100 mg/kg 50 mg/kg every 12 hours IV\n< 2 kg + every 12 + 50 mg/kg\ncefotaxime IV hours cefotaxime IV every 12\n50 mg/kg every 12 hours + 50 mg/kg every 12 hours hours\ngentamicin +\nIV gentamicin\n3 mg/kg IV\nonce daily 3 mg/kg\nonce daily\n0 to 7 ampicillin IV ampicillin IV cloxacillin IV cloxacillin\ndays 100 mg/kg every 8 hours 100 mg/kg 50 mg/kg every 8 hours IV\n\u2265 2 kg + every 8 + 50 mg/kg\ncefotaxime IV hours cefotaxime IV every 8\n50 mg/kg every 8 hours + 50 mg/kg every 8 hours hours\ngentamicin +\nIV gentamicin\n5 mg/kg IV\nonce daily 5 mg/kg\nonce daily\n8 days ampicillin IV ampicillin IV cloxacillin IV cloxacillin\nto 100 mg/kg every 8 hours 100 mg/kg 50 mg/kg every 6 hours IV\n< 1 + every 8 + 50 mg/kg\nmonth cefotaxime IV hours cefotaxime IV every 6\n\u2265 2 kg 50 mg/kg every 8 hours + 50 mg/kg every 8 hours hours\ngentamicin +\nIV gentamicin\n5 mg/kg IV\nonce daily 5 mg/kg\nonce daily\n1 to 3 ampicillin IV ampicillin IV cloxacillin IV cloxacillin\nmonths 100 mg/kg every 8 hours 100 mg/kg 50 mg/kg every 6 hours IV\n+ every 8 + 50 mg/kg\nceftriaxone IV 100 mg/kg on D1 hours ceftriaxone IV 100 mg/kg on D1 every 6\nthen starting on D2: 100 mg/kg once + then starting on D2: 100 mg/kg once hours\ndaily or 50 mg/kg every 12 hours gentamicin daily or 50 mg/kg every 12 hours +\nIV gentamicin\n2.5 mg/kg IV\nevery 8 2.5 mg/kg\nhours every 8\nhours\nPage 22 1/ 409\n> 3 ceftriaxone IV cloxacillin IV\nmonths Children: 100 mg/kg on D1 then starting on D2: 100 Children < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours\nmg/kg once daily or 50 mg/kg every 12 hours (max.

The\ninfection is noncontagious.\nClostridium tetani is introduced into the body through a wound and produces a toxin whose action on the central\nnervous system is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus.\nTetanus is entirely preventable by vaccination. It occurs in people who have not been fully vaccinated before exposure\nor have not received adequate post-exposure prophylaxis. In these individuals, most breaks in the skin or mucous\nmembranes carry a risk of tetanus, but the wounds with the greatest risk are: the stump of the umbilical cord in\nneonates, puncture wounds, wounds with tissue loss or contamination with foreign material or soil, avulsion and crush\ninjuries, sites of non-sterile injections, chronic wounds (e.g. lower extremity ulcers), burns and bites. Surgical or\nobstetrical procedures performed under non-sterile conditions also carry a risk of tetanus.\nClinical features\nGeneralised tetanus is the most frequent and severe form of the infection. It presents as muscular rigidity, which\nprogresses rapidly to involve the entire body, and muscle spasms, which are very painful. Level of consciousness is not\naltered.\nChildren and adults\nAverage time from exposure to onset of symptoms is 7 days (3 to 21 days).\nMuscular rigidity begins in the jaw muscles (difficulty with then inability to open mouth [trismus] preventing the patient\nfrom speaking, eating), spreading to the face (fixed smile), neck (difficulty with swallowing), to the trunk (restriction\nof respiratory muscles; hyperextension of spine [opisthotonus]), to the abdomen (guarding) and to the limbs (flexion\nof the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs).\nMuscle spasms, which are very painful, appear at the onset or when muscular rigidity becomes generalised. They\nare triggered by stimuli (noise, light, touch) or arise spontaneously. Spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles\nmay cause respiratory distress or aspiration.\nNeonates\nIn 90% of cases, initial symptoms appear within 3 to 14 days of birth.\nThe first signs are significant irritability and difficulty sucking (rigidity of the lips, trismus) then rigidity becomes\ngeneralised, as in adults. Any neonate, who initially sucked and cried normally, presenting with irritability and difficulty\nsucking 3 to 28 days after birth and demonstrating rigidity and muscle spasms should be assumed to have neonatal\ntetanus.\nTreatment\nHospitalisation is needed and usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks. Correct management can reduce mortality even in hospitals\nwith limited resources.\nGeneral measures\nEnsure intensive nursing care.\nThe patient should be in a dark, quiet room. Blindfold neonates with a cloth bandage.\nPage 22 4/ 409\nHandle the patient carefully, while sedated and as little as possible; change position every 3 to 4 hours to avoid\nbedsores.\nTeach family the danger signs and instruct them to call the nurse for the slightest respiratory symptom (cough,\ndifficulty breathing, apnoea, excessive secretions, cyanosis, etc.).\nEstablish IV access for hydration, IV injections.\nGentle suction of secretions (mouth, oropharynx).\nInsert a nasogastric tube for hydration, feeding and administration of oral medications.\nProvide hydration and nutrition in feeds divided over 24 hours. In neonates, give expressed breast milk every 3 hours\n(risk of hypoglycaemia).\nNeutralisation of toxin\nhuman tetanus immunoglobulin IM\nNeonates, children and adults: 500 IU single dose, injected into 2 separate sites\nInhibition of toxin production\nmetronidazole\na\nIV infusion (30 minutes; 60 minutes in neonates) for 7 days\nNeonates:\n0 to 7 days: 15 mg/kg on D1 then, after 24 hours, 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours\n8 days to < 1 month (< 2 kg): same doses\n8 days to < 1 month (\u2265 2 kg): 15 mg/kg every 12 hours\nChildren 1 month and over: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (max. 1500 mg daily)\nAdults: 500 mg every 8 hours\nControl of rigidity and spasms, and sedation of the patient\nDiazepam should decrease the frequency and intensity of spams without causing respiratory depression. The dose and\nfrequency of administration depend on the patient\u2019s clinical response and tolerance.\nThere is a high risk of respiratory depression and hypotension when using diazepam, especially in children and\nelderly patients. Constant and close monitoring of the patient\u2018s respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation\n(SpO ) is essential, with immediate availability of equipment for manual ventilation (Ambu bag, face mask) and\n2\nintubation, suction (electric if possible) and Ringer lactate.\nA continuous IV infusion of diazepam requires the use of a dedicated vein (no other infusion/injection in this\nvein); avoid the antecubital fossa if possible.\nDo not stop treatment abruptly; an abrupt stop can cause spasms.\nPage 22 5/ 409\nNeonates diazepam emulsion for injection (10 mg ampoule, 5 mg/ml, 2 ml)\n0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg by slow IV injection (3 to 5 minutes) every 1 to 4 hours depending on the severity\nand the persistence of the spasms as long as the RR is \u2265 30.\nIf despite hourly diazepam the spasms persist, start a continuous infusion of diazepam with an\nelectric syringe: 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/hour (2.4 to 12 mg/kg every 24 hours). Start with 0.1 mg/kg/hour\nand if symptoms persist, increase by 0.1 mg/kg/hour as long as RR is \u2265 30.\nIf in spite of 0.5 mg/kg/hour symptoms persist, the dose can be increased up to 0.8 mg/kg/hour as\nlong as the RR \u2265 30.\nDiluted diazepam emulsion does not keep for more than 6 hours.\nExample:\nNeonate weighing 3 kg (administration by electric syringe)\n0.1 mg/kg/hour x 3 kg = 0.3 mg/hour\nDilute one 10 mg ampoule of diazepam emulsion for injection in 50 ml of 10% glucose to obtain a\nsolution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml.\nAdminister 1.5 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) \u00f7 dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour i.e. 0.3 (mg/hour) \u00f7 0.2\n(mg/ml) = 1.5 ml/hour].\nIf an electric syringe is not available, diluting the diazepam emulsion in an infusion bag for continuous\ninfusion may be considered. Weigh the risks associated with this mode of administration (accidental\nbolus or insufficient dose). The infusion should be monitored closely to avoid any change, however\nsmall, of the prescribed rate.\nChildren Same doses and protocol as in neonates but:\n> 1 Use diazepam solution for injection 5 mg/ml: (10 mg ampoule, 5 mg/ml, 2 ml). (a)\nmonth These doses can be administered as long as the RR is:\nand \u2265 30 in children under 1 year\nadults \u2265 25 in children 1 to 4 years\n\u2265 20 in children 5 to 12 years\n\u2265 14 in children over 12 years\n\u2265 12 in adults\nExamples:\nChild weighing 6 kg (continuous IV infusion using a pediatric infusion set; 1 ml = 60 drops)\n0.1 mg/kg/hour x 6 kg = 0.6 mg/hour\nDilute one 10 mg ampoule of diazepam solution for injection in 50 ml of 5% glucose (10%\nglucose if child < 3 months) to obtain a solution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml.\nAdminister 3 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) \u00f7 dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour i.e. 0.6 (mg/hour) \u00f7 0.2\n(mg/ml) = 3 ml/hour] or 3 drops/minute (in a paediatric infusion set ml/hour = drops/minute).\nAdult weighing 60 kg (standard adult infusion set, 1 ml = 20 drops)\n0.1 mg/kg/hour x 60 kg = 6 mg/hour\nDilute 5 ampoules of 10 mg of diazepam solution (50 mg) in 250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride or\n5% glucose to obtain a solution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml.\nAdminister 30 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) \u00f7 dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour e.g. 6 (mg/hour) \u00f7 0.5\n(mg/ml) = 30 ml/hour] or 10 drops/minute.\n(a) Administer the first dose rectally if an IV cannot be placed immediately.\nCount the volume of the infusion of diazepam as part of the patient\u2019s daily fluid intake.\nPage 22 6/ 409\nWhen the frequency and severity of the spasms have decreased, start weaning the diazepam (gradually decrease the\nrate of infusion):\nCalculate the total daily dose of IV diazepam and administer it orally in 4 divided doses, 6 hours apart, via\nnasogastric (NG) b tube.\nGive first NG dose and decrease rate of IV infusion by 50%.\nGive second NG dose and stop IV diazepam infusion.\nIf withdrawal signs c appear, wean more slowly.\nOnce on diazepam PO, wean by 10 to 20% of the original dose daily, until at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg every 6 hours.\nThen increase the interval from every 6 hours to every 8 hours for 24 hours as tolerated (wean more slowly if\nwithdrawal signs appear).\nContinue to increase the interval between the doses from every 8 hours to every 12 hours and then to every 24\nhours before stopping the diazepam.\nEach step should be for 24 hours or more if withdrawal signs appear.\nNotes:\nIt is often at these smaller doses that it is difficult to wean diazepam. If this is the case, slow the wean further:\ndropping the % wean (e.g. 5% wean every 24 hours instead of 10% wean) or increasing the interval between weans\n(e.g. going from every 24 hours to every 48 hours).\nIf the patient is also receiving morphine, wean diazepam first then, wean morphine.\nNon-pharmacological measures to reduce withdrawal: reduce environmental stimuli; swaddle infants, frequent\nfeedings.\nInfants who have had tetanus remain hypertonic, even when they are no longer having spams.\nTreatment of pain\nmorphine PO (via nasogastric tube) if necessary (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nWhen morphine is administered with diazepam the risk of respiratory depression is increased, thus closer monitoring is\nrequired. When morphine is no longer required, wean the same way as diazepam.\nTreatment of the entry point and associated infections\nSearch systematically the entry wound. Provide local treatment under sedation: cleansing and for deep wounds,\nirrigation and debridement.\nCord infection: do not excise or debride; treat bacterial omphalitis and sepsis, add to metronidazole IV: cloxacillin IV\n+ cefotaxime IV or cloxacillin IV + gentamicin IV (for doses, see Bacterial meningitis).\nTetanus vaccination\nAs tetanus does not confer immunity, vaccination against tetanus must be administered once the patient has\nrecovered.\nIn case of neonatal tetanus, initiate the vaccination of the mother.\nPrevention\nOf critical importance, given the difficulty of treating tetanus once established.\n1) Post-exposure prophylaxis\nIn all cases:\nCleansing and disinfection of the wound, and removal of any foreign body.\nAntibiotics are not prescribed routinely for prophylaxis. The decision to administer an antibiotic (metronidazole\nor penicillin) is made on a case-by-case basis, according to the patient\u2019s clinical status.\nPage 22 7/ 409\nDepending on pre-exposure vaccination status:\nTetanus vaccine (TV) d and immunoglobulin: see indications below.\nComplete vaccination (3 or more doses) Incomplete vaccination\nTime since administration of last dose: (less than 3 doses)\nType of wound\nor no vaccination\n< 5 years 5-10 years > 10 years or unknown status\nTV\nMinor, clean None None 1 booster Initiate or complete TV\ndose\nTV\nTV Initiate or complete TV\nOther None 1 booster\n1 booster dose and administer tetanus immunoglobulin\ndose\ntetanus vaccine IM\nChildren and adults: 0.5 ml per dose\nIf no vaccination or unknown vaccination status: administer at least 2 doses at an interval of 4 weeks.\nIf incomplete vaccination: administer one dose.\nThen, to ensure long-lasting protection, administer additional doses to complete a total of 5 doses, as indicated in\nthe table below.\nhuman anti-tetanus immunoglobulin IM\nChildren and adults: 250 IU single dose; 500 IU for wounds more than 24 hours old.\nInject the vaccine and the immunoglobulin in 2 different sites, using a separate syringe for each.\n2) Routine vaccination (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\nChildren: 6 doses in total: a first series of 3 doses of DTP or DTP + HepB or DTP + HepB + Hib before the age of\n1 year, administered at an interval of 1 month (e.g. at the age of 6, 10 and 14 weeks), then a dose of a vaccine\ncontaining tetanus toxoid between the age of 12 and 23 months, a dose between the age of 4 to 7 years, then a\ndose between the age of 12 and 15 years.\nWomen of childbearing age: 5 doses during the reproductive years: a series of 3 doses of Td with an interval of at\nleast one month between the first and second dose and an interval of at least 6 months between the second and\nthird dose, then two other doses, each at minimum interval of one year, e.g. during pregnancies (see table below).\nPregnant women: if a woman has never been vaccinated or if her vaccination status is unknown: 2 doses of\nTd during the pregnancy to reduce the risk of tetanus in mother and neonate: the first as soon as possible during\nthe pregnancy and the second at least 4 weeks later and at least 2 weeks before delivery. This vaccination\nschedule protects more than 80% of neonates from tetanus.

Enteric fevers have insidious onset and vary\nfrom mild to severe.\nThe characteristic sign is prolonged fever, which gradually increases during the first week, plateaus the second\nweek then decreases between the third and fourth week.\nNon-specific signs and symptoms are frequently associated: gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain,\nconstipation or diarrhoea, vomiting), headache, malaise, chills, fatigue, non productive cough and/or\nhepatosplenomegaly.\nErythematous maculopapular rash on the trunk extreme fatigue and/or relative bradycardia (heart rate-temperature\ndissociation) may be present.\nSerious complications affect about 27% of hospitalised patients [1] and usually occur during the second or third\nweek of illness. These may incude decreased level of consciousness, intestinal haemorrhage or perforation\nor peritonitis, shock, or nephritis. In pregnant women, severe infection may lead to foetal complications\n(miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine death).\nRelapse may occur 2 to 3 weeks after recovery. It is usually not due to antibiotic resistance, and re-treatment is\nrequired.\nClinical diagnosis is difficult as enteric fevers resembles other infections present in regions where they are\nendemic. The main differential diagnoses are: malaria, brucellosis, leptospirosis, typhus, rickettsiosis,\nsepsis and dengue.\nLaboratory\nCulture of S. Typhi or Paratyphi and drug susceptibility test (blood and stool specimens).\nIn all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see Malaria, Chapter 6).\nWidal agglutination test, other serologic tests, and rapid diagnostic tests are not recommended (low sensitivity and\nspecificity).\nTreatment\nIn all cases\nHydrate and treat fever (Chapter 1). Fever usually resolves 4 to 5 days after starting effective antibiotic treatment.\nChoice of antibiotic treatment depends on the susceptibility of the strain, or when susceptibility is unknown, on\nrecent data on susceptibility of strains in the region. Check national recommendations.

In patients\nwith unexplained fever, brucellosis should be considered when risk factors are present: consumption of unpasteurized\nmilk products; exposure to livestock (e.g. livestock farmers, veterinarians, butchers, slaughterhouse workers).\nLocalised form\nPrimary infection may progress to localised infection (even several months or years later), mainly:\nosteoarticular: sacroiliac joint and often particularly lower limbs joints; spine (intervertebral disk infection, vertebral\nosteomyelitis)\ngenito-urinary: orchitis, epididymitis\npulmonary: bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy\nneurological : meningitis, encephalitis, polyneuritis\nParaclinical investigations\nLaboratory\nBlood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis. It is positive only in the acute phase. The bacteria grow slowly (7 to\n21 days).\nSerological tests (Rose Bengal, Wright agglutination test, indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, etc.) provide\npresumptive diagnoses.\nIn the event of neurological signs or meningitis, lumbar puncture shows clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that may\ncontain high white blood cell count; high protein concentration in CSF; low CSF glucose.\nRule out malaria in endemic regions (rapid test).\nExclude tuberculosis if cough > 2 weeks (sputum smear microscopy).\nPage 23 3/ 409\nRadiography\nJoint pain (hips, knees, ankles, vertebrae, sacroiliac joint): small erosions or destruction or joint space narrowing.\nOften involves the spine, particularly the lumbar spine, causing spondylodiskitis.\nPulmonary signs: chest x-ray often normal.

There are often outbreaks after heavy\nrainfall or flooding.\nClinical features\nApproximately 90% of cases are asymptomatic or mild with a favourable outcome. 5 to 15% of cases present a\nsevere form with multiple organ dysfunction and a high mortality rate without prompt treatment.\nMild form\nAcute phase (septicaemic):\nSudden onset of high fever with chills, headache, myalgia (especially calf and lumbar pain), photophobia, ocular\npain. Bilateral conjunctival suffusion affecting the bulbar conjunctiva (redness without discharge) is a\ncharacteristic sign, but not always present.\nMay be associated with: gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), non-\nproductive cough, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and sometimes, skin rash.\nImmune phase:\nThe signs of the acute phase regress after 5 to 7 days then reappear for a few days usually in a milder form\n(milder fever, less severe myalgia) then disappear.\nSigns of meningitis (thought to be of immune origin) are however very common during this phase.\nSevere or ictero-haemorrhagic form\nThe onset is the same but a few days later the symptoms worsen: renal disorders (oliguria or polyuria), hepatic disorder\n(jaundice), widespread haemorrhages (purpura, ecchymoses, epistaxis, haemoptysis, etc.), pulmonary signs (chest pain)\nor cardiac signs (myocarditis, pericarditis).\nDiagnosis is difficult because of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.

It occurs in epidemic waves when conditions favourable to the transmission of\nbody lice are met: cold climate/season, overcrowding and very poor sanitation (e.g. refugee camps, prisons). Endemic\nfoci of LBRF are mainly the Sudan and the Horn of Africa (especially Ethiopia). LBRF can be associated with louse-\nborne typhus (see Eruptive rickettsioses). The mortality rate for untreated LBRF ranges from 15 to 40%.\nClinical features\nRelapsing fever is characterized by febrile episodes separated by afebrile periods of approximately 7 days (4 to 14\ndays).\nThe initial febrile episode lasts up to 6 days:\nSudden onset of high fever (axillary temperature > 39 \u00b0C), severe headache and asthenia, diffuse pain (muscle,\njoint, back pain), often associated with gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting,\ndiarrhoea).\nSplenomegaly is common; bleeding signs (e.g. petechiae, subconjunctival haemorrhage, epistaxis, bleeding\ngums), jaundice or neurological symptoms may be observed.\nThe febrile episode terminates in a crisis with an elevation in temperature, heart rate and blood pressure,\nfollowed by a fall in temperature and blood pressure, which may last for several hours.\nFollowing the initial febrile episode, the cycle usually reccurs; each episode is less severe than the previous one and\nthe patient develops temporary immunity.\nComplications:\ncollapse during defervescence, myocarditis, cerebral haemorrhage;\nduring pregnancy: abortion, preterm delivery, in utero foetal death, neonatal death.\nIn practice, in an applicable epidemiological setting (see above), a suspect case of LBRF is, according to WHO, a\npatient with high fever and two of the following symptoms: severe joint pain, chills, jaundice or signs of bleeding (nose\nor other bleeding) or a patient with high fever who is responding poorly to antimalarial drugs. Clothing should be\nchecked for the presence of body lice and nits.\nLaboratory\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Borrelia in thick or thin blood films (Giemsa stain). Blood samples must be\ncollected during febrile periods. Spirochetes are not found in the peripheral blood during afebrile periods. In addition,\nthe number of circulating spirochetes tends to decrease with each febrile episode.\nTreatment\nAntibiotic treatment (suspect or confirmed cases and close contacts):\ndoxycycline PO\nChildren: 4 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) single dose\nAdults: 200 mg single dose\nor\nerythromycin PO\nChildren under 5 years: 250 mg single dose\nChildren 5 years and over and adults: 500 mg single dose\nPage 24 4/ 409\nor\nazithromycin PO\nChildren: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) single dose\nAdults: 500 mg single dose\nTreatment of pain and fever (paracetamol PO) and prevention or treatment of dehydration in the event of\nassociated diarrhoea.\nElimination of body lice is essential in control of epidemics (see Pediculosis, Chapter 4).\nPage 24 5/ 409\nTick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)\nLast update: October 2022\nTBRFs are caused by different Borrelia species. They are endemic in temperate and warm regions of the word,\nespecially in Africa (Tanzania, DRC, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, the Horn of Africa) and mainly in rural areas. TBRF is a\nmajor cause of morbidity and mortality in children and pregnant women. The mortality rate for untreated TBRF ranges\nfrom 2 to 15%.\nClinical features\nThe clinical manifestations and complications of TBRF are similar to those of LBRF but central nervous system (CNS)\ninvolvement (particularly lymphocytic meningitis) is more frequent than in LBRF and the number of relapses is higher.\nThe clinical diagnosis is difficult, especially during the first episode: cases occur sporadically rather than in outbreaks;\nthe tick bite is painless and usually unnoticed by the patient; symptoms are very similar to those of malaria, typhoid\nfever, leptospirosis, certain arbovirosis (yellow fever, dengue) or rickettsiosis, and meningitis.\nLaboratory\nAs for LBRF, the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Borrelia in the patient\u2019s blood.\nRepeat the examination if the first smear is negative despite strong clinical suspicion.\nIn all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see Malaria, Chapter 6).\nTreatment\nAntibiotic treatment:\ndoxycycline PO for 7 to 10 days\nChildren under 45 kg: 2.2 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) 2 times daily\nChildren 45 kg and over and adults: 100 mg 2 times daily\nor\nazithromycin PO for 7 to 10 days (if doxycycline is contra-indicated or not available)\nChildren: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) once daily\nAdults: 500 mg once daily\nor\nceftriaxone IV a for 10 to 14 days (for pregnant women or in case of CNS involvement)\nChildren: 50 to 75 mg/kg (max. 2 g) once daily\nAdults: 2 g once daily\nTreatment of pain and fever (paracetamol PO) and prevention or treatment of dehydration in the event of\nassociated diarrhoea.\nAntibiotic treatment can trigger a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction with high fever, chills, fall in blood pressure and\nsometimes shock. It is recommended to monitor the patient for 2 hours after the first dose of antibiotic, for\noccurrence and management of severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (symptomatic treatment of shock).\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction appears to occur more frequently in LBRF than in TBRF.\nPage 24 6/ 409\nFootnotes\n(a) For IV administration of ceftriaxone, dilute with water for injection only.\nPage 24 7/ 409\nEruptive rickettsioses\nLast update: October 2022\nRickettsioses are eruptive fevers caused by bacteria of the genus Rickettsia and transmitted to man by an arthropod\nvector. Three main groups are distinguished: typhus group, spotted fever group and scrub typhus group.\nClinical features\nCommon to all forms:\nSudden onset of fever (temperature of over 39 \u00b0C) with severe headache and myalgias.\n3 to 5 days later; onset of generalised cutaneous eruption (see below).\nHypotension; non-dissociated rapid heart rate (variable).\nTyphoid state: prostration, obnubilation, confusion and extreme asthenia, particularly marked in typhus forms.\nInoculation eschar: painless, black crusted lesion surrounded by a erythematous halo at the site of the bite.\nAlways check for this significant sign.\nNon-cutaneous signs vary from one form to another, and are atypical and variable (see below).\nPage 24 8/ 409\nGroup Typhus Spotted fever Scrub\ntyphus\nForm Epidemic typhus Murine typhus Mediterranean Rocky Other Old- Scrub typhus\nspotted fever Mountain World tick-\nspotted fever borne fevers\nPathogen R. prowasekii R. typhi R. conorii R. rickettsii R. sibirica, R.

However, the\ngeographical distribution of borrelioses and rickettsioses may overlap, and thus a reaction may occur due to a possible co-\ninfection (see Borreliosis).\nPage 25 0/ 409\nChapter 8: Viral diseases\nMeasles\nPoliomyelitis\nRabies\nViral hepatitis\nDengue\nViral haemorrhagic fevers\nHIV infection and AIDS\nPage 25 1/ 409\nMeasles\nMeasles is a highly contagious acute viral infection, transmitted by the airborne route (inhalation of respiratory droplets\nspread by infected individuals). The disease mainly affects children under 5 years of age and can be prevented by\nimmunization.\nFor more information, refer to the guide Management of a measles epidemic, MSF.\nClinical features\nThe average incubation period is 10 days.\nProdromal or catarrhal phase (2 to 4 days)\nHigh fever (39-40 \u00b0C) with cough, coryza (nasal discharge) and/or conjunctivitis (red and watery eyes).\nKoplik\u2019s spots: tiny bluish-white spots on an erythematous base, found on the inside of the cheek. This sign is\nspecific of measles infection, but may be absent at the time of examination. Observation of Koplik's spots is not\nrequired for diagnosing measles.\nEruptive phase (4 to 6 days)\nOn average 3 days after the onset of symptoms: eruption of erythematous, non- pruritic maculopapules, which\nblanch with pressure. The rash begins on the forehead then spreads downward to the face, neck, trunk\n(second day), abdomen and lower limbs (third and fourth day).\nAs the rash progresses, prodromal symptoms subside. In the absence of complications, the fever disappears once\nthe rash reaches the feet.\nThe rash fades around the fifth day in the same order that it appeared (from the head to the feet).\nThe eruptive phase is followed by skin desquamation during 1 to 2 weeks, very pronounced on pigmented skin (the skin\ndevelops a striped appearance).\nIn practice, a patient presenting with fever and erythematous maculopapular rash and at least one of the following\nsigns: cough or runny nose or conjunctivitis, is a clinical case of measles.\nComplications\nMost measles cases experience at least one complication:\nRespiratory and ENT: pneumonia, otitis media, laryngotracheobronchitis\nOcular: purulent conjunctivitis, keratitis, xerophthalmia (risk of blindness)\nGastrointestinal: diarrhoea with or without dehydration, benign or severe stomatitis\nNeurological: febrile seizures; rarely, encephalitis\nAcute malnutrition, provoked or aggravated by measles (post-measles period)\nPneumonia and dehydration are the most common immediate causes of death.\nCase management\nAdmit as inpatient children with at least one major complication:\nInability to eat/drink/suck, or vomiting\nAltered consciousness or seizures\nDehydration\nSevere pneumonia (pneumonia with respiratory distress or cyanosis or SpO < 90%)\n2\nAcute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) a\nCorneal lesions (pain, photophobia, erosion or opacity)\nPage 25 2/ 409\nSevere oral lesions that prevent eating\nAcute malnutrition\nTreat as outpatient children with no major complications, no complications or minor complications:\nPneumonia without severe signs\nAcute otitis media\nPurulent conjunctivitis (no corneal lesions)\nDiarrhoea without dehydration\nOral candidiasis that does not interfere with eating\nIf in doubt, keep the child under observation for a few hours.\nIsolation\nIsolation of hospitalized patients\nMeasles cases treated as outpatients should be kept at home during this period.\nTreatment\nSupportive and preventive treatment\nTreat fever: paracetamol (Fever, Chapter 1).\nMake the child drink (high risk of dehydration).\nGive smaller, more frequent meals or breastfeed more frequently (every 2 to 3 hours).\nClear the nasopharynx (nose-blowing or nasal lavages) to prevent secondary respiratory infection and improve the\nchild\u2019s comfort.\nClean the eyes with clean water 2 times daily and administer retinol on D1 and D2 (see Xerophthalmia, Chapter 5) to\nprevent ocular complications.\nIn children under 5 years: amoxicillin PO for 5 days as a preventive measure (reduction of respiratory and ocular\ninfections).\nIn the event of watery diarrhoea without dehydration: oral rehydration according to WHO Plan A (see Dehydration,\nChapter 1).\nInsert a nasogastric tube for a few days if oral lesions prevent the child from drinking.\nTreatment of complications\nPage 25 3/ 409\nTreatment of complications\nSevere pneumonia ceftriaxone IV or IM + cloxacillin IV then change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid\nPO (see Chapter 2)\n+ oxygen if cyanosis or SpO < 90%\n2\n+ salbutamol if expiratory wheezing and sibilant rales on auscultation\nIn all cases, close monitoring.\nPneumonia without severe amoxicillin PO for 5 days\nsigns\nCroup Inpatient monitoring (risk of worsening). Keep the child calm. Agitation and crying\nexacerbate the symptoms.\nFor severe croup:\ndexamethasone IM: 0.6 mg/kg single dose\n+ nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline, 1 mg/ml ampoule): 0.5 ml/kg (max. 5 ml)\n+ oxygen if cyanosis or SpO < 90%\n2\nIntensive monitoring until symptoms resolve.\nAcute otitis media See Otitis, Chapter 2.\nDehydration Per oral route or IV depending on the degree of dehydration.\nOral candidiasis See Stomatitis, Chapter 3.\nPurulent conjunctivitis See Conjunctivitis, Chapter 5.\nKeratitis/keratoconjunctivitis tetracycline 1% eye ointment 2 times daily for 7 days\n+ retinol PO one dose on D1, D2 and D8 (see Xerophthalmia, Chapter 5)\n+ eye protection and pain management (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nNo topical corticosteroids.\nXerophthalmia See Xerophthalmia, Chapter 5.\nFebrile seizures See Seizures, Chapter 1.\nPrevention\nNo chemoprophylaxis for contacts.\nVaccination:\nBetween 9 and 12 months: one dose of 0.5 ml. The WHO recommends a second dose between 15 and 18\nmonths. Respect an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses.\nWhere there is high risk of infection (overcrowding, epidemics, malnutrition, infants born to a mother with HIV\ninfection, etc.), administer a supplementary dose from 6 months of age then continue vaccination schedule.\nChildren under 15 years who have missed either one or both doses of routine vaccination should be vaccinated\nwhen they come in contact with health services. Check national recommendations.\nPage 25 4/ 409\nFootnotes\n(a) Symptoms (hoarse crying or voice, difficulty breathing, a high-pitched inspiratory wheeze [inspiratory stridor], characteristic\n\"barking\" cough) are caused by inflammation and narrowing of the larynx. Croup is considered benign or \u201cmoderate\u201d if the\nstridor occurs when the child is agitated or crying, but disappears when the child is calm. The child should be monitored\nduring this period, however, because his general and respiratory status can deteriorate rapidly. Croup is severe when the\nstridor persists at rest or is associated with signs of respiratory distress.\nPage 25 5/ 409\nPoliomyelitis\nPoliomyelitis is an acute viral infection due to a poliovirus (serotypes 1, 2 or 3). Human-to-human transmission is direct\n(faecal-oral) or indirect (ingestion of food and water contaminated by stool). Humans are the only reservoir of the virus.\nIn principle the disease can be eradicated by mass vaccination.\nIn endemic areas, poliomyelitis mainly affect children under 5 years not (or not fully) vaccinated, but the infection can\naffect persons of any age, especially in areas where population immunity is low.\nClinical features\nUp to 90% of cases are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms [1] .\nNon-paralytic form: a non-specific febrile illness with muscle pain, headache, vomiting, backache; no neurological\ninvolvement. As spontaneous recovery usually occurs within 10 days, diagnosis is rarely made outside epidemic\ncontexts.\nParalytic form: in less than 1% of cases, after the non-specific signs, the patient develops rapid onset (from the\nmorning to the evening) asymmetrical acute flaccid paralysis, predominantly of the lower limbs, with ascending\nprogression. The muscles become soft with diminished reflexes. Sensation is maintained. The disease is life\nthreatening if paralysis involves the respiratory muscles or muscles of swallowing. Initial urinary retention is common.\nGastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), muscle pain and meningeal symptoms may also occur.\nLaboratory\nLook for the polio virus in stool samples. The virus is excreted for one month after infection, but only intermittently;\ntherefore, 2 samples must be collected with an interval of 24-48 hours, and within 14 days of onset of symptoms [2]\n. Send the stool samples to a reference laboratory, with a clinical description of the patient. The stool samples must be\nstored and transported between 0 \u00b0C and 8 \u00b0C.\nTreatment\nHospitalise patients with the paralytic form: rest, prevent bed sores in bedridden patients, give analgesics (do not\ngive IM injections to patients in the febrile phase), ventilate patients with respiratory paralysis.\nPhysiotherapy once the lesions are stable to prevent muscle atrophy and contractures.\nCare for sequelae: physiotherapy, surgery and prosthetics.\nOutbreak control in case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)\nConsider any patient with AFP as a suspected case of poliomyelitis.\nSend stool samples to a reference laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.\nOrganize vaccination of all children under 5 years living in the area (from the same village or neighbouring villages)\nirrespective of their vaccination status, within 14 days of laboratory confirmation and with the available vaccine\n(round 0) [3] .\nOrganize two mass vaccination campaigns within 8 weeks of the laboratory confirmation. The type of vaccine, the\narea and the age groups are determined by epidemiological data.\nOrganize a mop-up (door-to-door) vaccination campaign wherever monitoring suggests that children have been\nmissed, to ensure interruption of transmission.\nSurveillance: for each case of AFP there are between 100 and 200 subclinical cases. Therefore, active surveillance\nto detect new cases is essential for epidemic control.\nPage 25 6/ 409\nPrevention\n3 types of vaccines exist:\na trivalent injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV),\na bivalent oral live attenuated poliovirus vaccine (bOPV), containing serotypes 1 and 3,\na monovalent oral type 2 vaccine (mOPV or nOPV) exclusively used for responding to epidemics.\nVaccination schedule: depends on the epidemiology of the virus.\nProtocols vary according to the country, follow national recommendations. For information, the WHO\nrecommends:\nPrimary vaccination\nSchedule\nEndemic or at risk zones (a) Other zones\nBirth 1 dose bOPV (b) \u2013\n6 weeks 1 dose bOPV 1 dose bOPV\n10 weeks 1 dose bOPV 1 dose bOPV\n14 weeks 1 dose bOPV + 1 dose IPV 1 dose bOPV + 1 dose IPV\n(a) Countries where poliomyelitis is endemic or zones at high risk of importation and subsequent spread of the virus.\n(b) The first dose of bOPV is administered at birth, or as soon as possible, to optimise seroconversion rates after subsequent\ndoses and induce mucosal protection.\nIn children who start routine vaccination late (after the age of 3 months), the dose of IPV is administered together with\nthe first dose of bOPV, followed by 2 doses of bOPV alone administered 4 weeks apart.\nThere is also an \u2018IPV only\u2019 schedule: 3 doses administered at least 4 weeks apart (e.g. at 6, 10 and 14 weeks) and a\nbooster dose at least 6 months later.\nIPV should eventually completely replace bOPV.\nReferences\n1.

There is no curative treatment; care is palliative.\nClinical features\nThe incubation period averages 20 to 90 days from exposure (75% of patients), but can be shorter (in severe\nexposure, e.g. bites to face, head and hands; multiple bites), or longer (20% of patients develop symptoms\nbetween 90 days and 1 year, and 5% more than 1 year after exposure).\nProdromal phase: itching or paraesthesiae or neuropathic pain around the site of exposure, and non-specific\nsymptoms (fever, malaise, etc.).\nNeurologic phase:\nEncephalitic form (furious form): psychomotor agitation or hydrophobia (throat spasms and panic, triggered by\nattempting to drink or sight/sound/touch of water) and aerophobia (similar response to a draft of air); sometimes\nseizures. The patient is calm and lucid between episodes. Infection evolves to paralysis and coma.\nParalytic form (less common, 20% of cases): progressive ascending paralysis resembling Guillain-Barr\u00e9\nsyndrome; evolves to coma.\nDiagnosis is often difficult: there may be no history of scratch or bite (exposure through licking) or wounds may have\nhealed; a reliable history may be difficult to obtain.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis\nDefinitions of exposure categories (WHO)\nCategory I Contact with animal, or licks on intact skin No exposure\nNibbles on exposed skin\nCategory II Minor exposure\nMinor bite(s) or scratch(es) without bleeding\nTransdermal bite(s) or scratch(es)\nLicks on broken skin\nCategory III Severe exposure\nContamination of mucous membranes by animal\u2019s saliva (licks)\nDirect contact with bats a\nPost-exposure prophylaxis is carried out for Category II and III exposures.\nTreatment of the wound\nIn all cases\nPage 25 8/ 409\nProlonged cleansing of the wound or contact site for 15 minutes to eliminate the virus, as soon as possible after\nexposure, is of critical importance. For skin: use soap, rinse copiously with running water, remove all foreign material;\napplication of a disinfectant (povidone iodine 10% or other) is an additional precaution which does not take the place\nof thorough wound washing. For mucous membranes (eye, mouth, etc.): rinse thoroughly with water or 0.9% sodium\nchloride. Local cleansing is indicated even if the patient presents late.\nAccording to condition/type of wound\nIn order to avoid inoculating virus deeper into the tissues, wounds are either not sutured at all (e.g. superficial, non-\nmutilating or puncture wounds), or are left open and re-evaluated in 48-72 hours, with a view to possible closure. Highly\ncontaminated wounds, or wounds that may compromise function, require surgical management (exploration, removal\nof foreign material, excision of necrotic tissue, copious irrigation with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer lactate,\nwith local or general anaesthesia). When suturing is indicated (face), rabies immunoglobulin should be administered\nseveral hours before wound closure (see below). Infected wounds are not sutured and reassessed daily.\nPassive and active immunisation\nGiven the duration of incubation, administration of vaccine/immunoglobulin is always a priority, even for patients\nexposed several months previously.\nAnti-rabies serotherapy\nRabies immunoglobulin is indicated after:\nCategory III exposures (except in patients who have received a full course of pre-exposure prophylaxis against\nrabies, see Prevention);\nCategory II and III exposures in immunocompromised patients b (even in patients who have received a full course of\npre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies).\nIt is intended to neutralize virus in the exposure site. It is given as a single dose on D0, with the first dose of rabies\nvaccine.\nhuman rabies immunoglobulin:\nChildren and adults: 20 IU/kg\nor\nhighly purified rabies immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments:\nChildren and adults: 40 IU/kg\nInfiltrate rabies immunoglobulin into and around the previously washed wound(s). Ensure it is not injected into a blood\nvessel (risk of shock).\nFor finger wounds, infiltrate very cautiously to avoid increased pressure in the tissue compartment (compartment\nsyndrome).\nIn the event of multiple wounds, dilute the dose 2- to 3-fold with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain a sufficient\nquantity to infiltrate all the sites exposed.\nInfiltrate rabies immunoglobulin into the wound even if it has already healed.\nFor mucosal exposures with no wound, rinse with rabies immunoglobulin diluted in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride.\nMonitor the patient during and after the injection (low risk of anaphylactic reaction).\nIf rabies immunoglobulin is not available on D0, the first dose of rabies vaccine is administered alone. Administer rabies\nimmunoglobulin as soon as possible between D0 and D7; from D8, it is not necessary to\nadminister rabies immunoglobulin as vaccine-induced antibodies begin to appear. [1]\nPost-exposure rabies prophylaxis\nPage 25 9/ 409\nA complete prophylaxis series is indicated for Category II and III exposures. It should be started on D0 and continued to\ncompletion if the risk of rabies has not been excluded c . Several different types of rabies vaccines prepared from cell\ncultures (CCEEV) exist. These vaccines must replace nerve tissue vaccines (NTV).\nProphylaxis schedules may vary from country to country, check national recommendations. The patient must be\nadministered the full course of doses indicated.\nMain post-exposure prophylaxis regimens [1]\nNo pre-exposure prophylaxis or unknown prophylaxis status\nor incomplete pre-exposure prophylaxis or complete pre-exposure prophylaxis with an NTV\nDate\nIM route (a)\nID route (b)\n1 dose = 0.5 or 1 ml depending on the\n1 dose = 0.1 ml\nmanufacturer\n2 doses (c) 2 doses (c)\nD0 1 dose (c)\n(1 dose in each arm or thigh) (1 dose in each arm)\n2 doses\nD3 1 dose\n(1 dose in each arm)\n2 doses\nD7 1 dose 1 dose\n(1 dose in each arm)\nD14 1 dose (d)\nD21 1 dose\n(a) IM route: there are two possible schedules, the Zagreb regimen (2-0-1-0-1) over 21 days or the 4-dose Essen regimen (1-1-\n1-1-0) over 14 to 28 days. The IM injection is administered into the anterolateral part of the thigh in children < 2 years; into\nthe deltoid muscle (arm) in children \u2265 2 years and adults; do not administer into the gluteal muscle.\n(b) ID route: inject into the deltoid muscle (or the suprascapular region or the anterolateral part of the thigh). Incorrect ID\ntechnique results in failure of post-exposure prophylaxis. If correct ID technique cannot be assured, use IM route.\n(c) As well as a single dose of rabies immunoglobulin on D0 if indicated.\n(d) The last injection can be administered between D14 and D28.\nNotes:\nIn immunocompromised patients: 1 dose on D0, 1 dose on D7 and 1 dose between D21 and D28.

Hepatitis A and\nB are common in developing countries where the vast majority of infections occur during childhood.\nThe clinical characteristics of all five diseases are similar enough to make differential diagnosis difficult; however, there\nare epidemiological, immunological and pathological differences. Patients with hepatitis B, C and D may later develop\nchronic liver disease.\nThe main characteristics of each type of viral hepatitis are summarized in the table below.\nClinical features\nAsymptomatic forms\nMild or anicteric forms are the most common, irrespective of the causal virus.\nIcteric forms\nInsidious or sudden onset with symptoms of varying intensity: fever, fatigue, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbance,\nfollowed by jaundice, dark coloured urine and more or less claycoloured stool.\nFulminant forms\nHepatocellular failure with severe cytolysis that can be fatal.

Transmission by transfusion of\ncontaminated blood and transplacental transmission to the foetus have also been reported.\nFour different serotypes of dengue have been described. Infection with one serotype provides a lifelong immunity to\nthat specific serotype, but only partial, short-term immunity to other serotypes. There is no specific antiviral treatment.\nDengue is a mainly urban disease, present in tropical and subtropical regions a , in particular in Asia, Central and South\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Outbreaks have been described in Eastern Africa.\nPrimary infection may be asymptomatic or present as mild or occasionally severe dengue fever. Subsequent infections\nincrease the risk of severe dengue.\nClinical features\nAfter the incubation period (4 to 10 days), the illness occurs in 3 phases:\nFebrile phase: high fever (39 to 40 \u00b0C) lasting 2 to 7 days, often accompanied by generalized aches, a\nmaculopapular rash and mild haemorrhagic manifestations.\nCritical phase (between the third and seventh day): at the end of the febrile phase, temperature decreases. The\nmajority of patients will have dengue without warning signs and proceed to the recovery phase. Certain patients will\ndevelop dengue with warning sign(s) at this stage. These patients are at higher risk for developing severe dengue.\nRecovery phase: patient improves, vital signs normalise, gastrointestinal symptoms subside and appetite returns.\nAt times, bradycardia and generalized pruritus.\nPage 26 8/ 409\nSymptoms according to severity (adapted from PAHO [1] )\nDengue Fever + 2 of the following symptoms:\nwithout warning Nausea, vomiting\nsigns Rash resembling measles\nGeneralized aches (headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, arthralgias)\nBenign mucocutaneous bleeding (petechiae, positive tourniquet test (a) , epistaxis, gingival\nbleeding)\nLeucopenia\nDengue Presence of at least one of these symptoms:\nwith warning signs Intense abdominal pain\nPersistent vomiting\nFluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion)\nMucosal bleeding\nHepatomegaly (> 2 cm)\nPostural hypotension\nAgitation or lethargy\nIncreasing haematocrit\nSevere dengue Severe fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion) with respiratory distress and/or shock\nSevere mucocutaneous bleeding\nSevere organ involvement (e.g.: transaminases > 1000 IU/litre, myocarditis, altered mental\nstatus)\n(a) Tourniquet test: inflate a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to a point midway between the systolic and diastolic\npressure for 5 min. The test is positive when 20 or more petechiae per 2.5 cm square are observed.\nMajor differential diagnoses\nOther conditions to consider include a wide range of acute febrile illnesses, e.g.:\nChikungunya, Zika, influenza, mononucleosis, measles, rubella, viral haemorrhagic fevers\nMalaria\nMeningococcemia, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsioses, other causes of sepsis\nLeukaemia\nLaboratory\nDiagnosis\nNS-1 antigen detection during febrile phase with rapid diagnostic test or ELISA (serum, plasma or blood).\nAntibody detection (complex interpretation):\nIgM detection 5 to 6 days after onset of illness may support (but does not confirm) a diagnosis of recent\ninfection;\nIgG detection may indicate prior infection by, or vaccination against, dengue virus or a closely related virus (e.g.\nchikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever).\nPCR may also be available in reference laboratories.\nIn all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see Malaria, Chapter 6).\nPage 26 9/ 409\nMonitoring disease course\nHaematocrit (Hct) or if available full blood count (FBC) at baseline, then daily if possible.\nA progressive increase in Hct is a warning sign. It indicates haemoconcentration due to increased vascular\npermeability (plasma leakage). Hct should be monitored frequently (before and after fluid administration) in\npatients with warning signs up to the end of the fluid treatment.\nLeukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common and improve as the recovery phase begins. Leukocytosis may\noccur with severe bleeding.\nLiver function tests if possible at baseline, then according to results.\nTreatment\nPatients in Group A (outpatients)\nPatients with no warning signs, able to drink sufficiently and with a normal urine output.\nBed rest and good hydration.\nFever and pain: paracetamol PO at the usual doses (see Fever, Chapter 1), maintaining a 6 to 8 hour interval\nbetween doses. Do not prescribe acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen or other NSAIDs.\nSeek medical attention if: no clinical improvement, persistent vomiting, cold extremities, agitation or lethargy,\nbreathing difficulties or absence of urine output.\nIf follow-up is impossible or symptoms cannot be monitored at home (patients living far from the health care\nfacility/living alone), hospitalise for observation.\nPatients in Group B (inpatients)\nPatients with any of the following:\nWarning sign(s)\nAcute (e.g. severe dehydation or malaria) or chronic (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular, renal or haemolytic disease,\nobesity) co-morbidities\nRisk factors for bleeding (e.g. anticoagulation, coagulopathy, peptic ulcer or gastritis, treatment with NSAIDs)\nPregnant women, patients under 1 year or 65 years and over or patients with difficulty drinking\nIn all cases:\nPlace the patient under a mosquito net; encourage oral fluid intake (including oral rehydration solution (ORS) if\nneeded).\nAvoid invasive procedures (nasogastric tube, IM injections) to minimize the risk of bleeding.\nFever and pain: paracetamol PO [2] with caution and without exceeding:\nchildren: 10 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours\nadults: 500 mg every 6 to 8 hours\nIn case of elevated transaminases \u2265 10 times the upper limit of normal, do not administer paracetamol.

If necessary, a total of 3 boluses can\nbe administered. If still no improvement after 3 bolus, consider as severe dengue (patients in Group C) and\ntransfer to intensive care unit.\nIf improvement after the first, second, or third bolus, reduce Ringer lactate:\nchildren and adults: 5 to 7 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours\npatients 65 years and over or with co-morbidities: 5 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours\nIf continuing improvement, reduce Ringer lactate (then stop as soon as possible to reduce the risk of fluid\noverload):\nchildren and adults: 3 to 5 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours, then 2 to 4 ml/kg/hour over 24 to 48 hours\npatients 65 years and over or with co-morbidities: 3 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours, then 2 ml/kg/hour over 24\nto 48 hours\nIf the patient deteriorates after initial improvement, resume the bolus therapy with Ringer lactate (up to 3 bolus)\nas above.\nPatients in Group C (intensive care unit)\nPatients with severe dengue requiring emergency treatment for managing shock and other complications (e.g. severe\nbleeding, acidosis, coagulopathy).\nPrevention\nIndividual protection: long sleeves and trousers, repellents, mosquito net (Aedes bites during the day).\nElimination of mosquito breeding sites (small collections of water in discarded tires, flower pots, and other\ncontainers).\nFootnotes\n(a) For more information:\nhttp://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_DengueTransmission_ITHRiskMap.png?ua=1\n(b) Adequate urine output: at least 1 ml/kg/hour in children and 0.5 ml/kg/hour in adults.

HIV-1 is more widespread than HIV-2, the latter mainly being found in West\nAfrica. HIV-2 is less virulent and less transmissible than HIV-1.\nHIV weakens the immune system by causing a deficit in CD4 T lymphocytes.\nEvolution of the disease\nPrimary infection or acute retroviral syndrome: 50 to 70% of newly infected individuals develop during\nseroconversion (from 15 days to 3 months post exposure), a viral syndrome with fever, malaise, and\nlymphadenopathy.\nAsymptomatic HIV infection (after seroconversion): a period of clinical latency, but not viral latency. The time\nperiod for progression from HIV infection to the development of severe immune deficiency in western countries is\napproximately 10 years. This period appears to be shorter in developing countries.\nSymptomatic HIV infection: with progressive destruction of the immune system, common and more severe\ndiseases occur more frequently, and with higher mortality, in seropositive individuals.\nAIDS: this stage corresponds to the development of severe opportunistic infections and neoplasms. From a\nbiological point of view, AIDS is defined as a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3. Without treatment the disease\nprogresses rapidly towards death.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed a clinical classification of HIV infection in 4 stages of severity for\nadults and adolescents and for children. [1]\nLaboratory\nDiagnosis of HIV infection\nThe diagnosis is made with serological (detection of antibodies against the virus) or virological (especially in infants)\ntesting.\nTesting should always be done voluntarily with informed consent.\nAll HIV test results must be strictly confidential in order to avoid discrimination.\nThe individual should have access to services offering pre-test and post-test counselling, treatment and support.\nA diagnosis of HIV infection can be made only after at least 2 different test results (2 different brands) are clearly\npositive: the positive result of an initial (highly sensitive) test must be confirmed through use of a second (highly\nspecific) test. In areas where HIV prevalence is low, diagnosis is confirmed after 3 positive test results.\nCD4 lymphocyte counts\nCD4 cell depletion is a marker of the progression of immune depression. The level of the CD4 cell count is a predictor\nof the development of opportunistic infections or neoplasms and can be used to orient their diagnosis, e.g. cerebral\ntoxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis appear when the CD4 count is below 100 cells/mm3 in adults. If clinical\nsymptoms/signs are present suggesting one of these infections, but the CD4 count is greater than or equal to 200\ncells/mm3, it is unlikely that that particular infection is present.\nOpportunistic infections\nPage 27 7/ 409\nIt is important to screen for serious opportunistic infections in those at risk (e.g. testing for cryptococcal antigen for all\nadults with a CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3 regardless of symptoms).\nTreatment of HIV infection\nAntiretroviral (ARV) treatment a\nA multi-drug (at least 3) antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the reference treatment. It does not eradicate the virus, but\nslows the progression of the disease and improves the patient\u2019s clinical state by reducing viral replication and\nconsequently increasing the CD4 cell count to levels beyond the threshold of opportunistic infections.\nTherapeutic classes\nFour major classes ARV are used:\nNRTI (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors): zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC),\ntenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC).\nNNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors): efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), etravirine (ETR). HIV-2 is\nnaturally resistant to NNRTIs.\nPI (protease inhibitors): atazanavir (ATV), lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir (RTV), darunavir (DRV).\nINI (integrase inhibitors): dolutegravir, raltegravir.\nPrinciples of ARV treatment\nDaily triple therapy must be taken for life to prevent the rapid development of resistance. It is important that the\npatient understands this and that adherence to treatment is optimal.\nFollow the ART protocols recommended by national HIV program.\nThe most widely used and easiest regimens to administer are 2 NRTI + 1 NNRTI: e.g. TDF/3TC/EFV.\nIn the event of treatment failure, all 3 drugs should be replaced with a second-line regimen: 2 other NRTIs + 1 PI.\nOther possible combinations exist which are less commonly used or more difficult to manage.\nCriteria for ARV treatment\nAs a priority ART should be initiated in all patients with WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 and patients with CD4 < 350 /mm3.\nHowever, those with higher CD4 counts can initiate ART.\nMonitoring of ARV treatment\nHIV viral load is an essential tool for monitoring the effectiveness of ARV. CD4 count is useful for identifying severely\nimmunosuppressed. Other tests such as blood count, tests for liver (ALAT) and renal function (creatinine clearance) are\nnot essential, but can be useful in detecting adverse effects.\nTreatment of opportunistic and other infections\nWith progressive immunosuppression, HIV-infected patients who are not receiving triple therapy (or patients on ART\nbut with poor adherence) become increasingly susceptible to infections. For conditions of clinical stages 2 and 3,\nstandard treatments are usually effective. Patients may benefit from primary prophylaxis against opportunistic\ninfections (see Primary prophylaxis). Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common serious opportunistic infection. It can be\ndifficult to diagnose in HIV-infected patients however.\nTreatment of pain\nTreat all patients for associated pain (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nPrevention of HIV infection\nPage 27 8/ 409\nSexual transmission\nThe most reliable method of prevention is the use of male or female condoms.\nMale circumcision decreases significantly the risk of HIV transmission.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections is essential as they increase the transmission of HIV\n(see Chapter 9).\nART to HIV positive and adherent partner does protect the negative partner from HIV infection.\nOccupational transmission\n(accidental needle stick injuries or injuries with contaminated objects, contact between a patient\u2019s blood and\nunprotected broken skin or mucous membranes)\nPrevention is based on use of standard precautions to avoid contamination with soiled material or potentially infected\nbody fluids.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): e.g. in the event of rape or occupational accidental exposure to blood, ARV\ntreatment initiated as soon as possible within 72 hours of exposure for a duration of 1 month may reduce the risk of\ninfection.\nNosocomial transmission\nPrevention of nosocomial HIV infection is based on the rational use of injections and strict respect for hygiene and\nsterilization and disinfection procedures for medical material.\nFor transfusion: strict respect of indications for transfusion and systematic serological screening of the donor\u2019s blood\nare the two indispensable precautions in the prevention of HIV transmission through transfusions.\nTransmission in injection drug users\nNeedle and syringe exchange programs with disposable needles and syringes for users can reduce the risk.\nMother-to-child transmission (MTCT)\nThe global rate of vertical transmission varies from 20 to 40%. The risk of transmission through breast-feeding is\nevaluated at approximately 12% and persists for the duration of breast-feeding.\nIn pregnant women: HIV transmission from mother-to-child may be reduced by ART. The protocol called Option\nB+ is the internationally preferred protocol. All HIV-infected pregnant women receive lifelong triple-drug therapy,\nregardless of the CD4 count or clinical stage, both for their own health and to prevent transmission to the child. The\nmost commonly recommended ART is TDF/3TC/EFV or TDF/FTC/EFV. Check national recommendations. In\naddition, ARVs are administered to the newborn.\nPrograms targeting pregnant women also include other preventive measures such as avoiding artificial rupture of\nthe membranes and systematic episiotomy.\nIn breast-feeding women: exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months of life, introduction of complementary\n(solid) foods at 6 months, gradual cessation of breast-feeding to the age of 12 months.\nPrevention of opportunistic infections\nIn the absence of ARV treatment, all HIV-infected individuals become symptomatic and evolve towards AIDS.\nHowever, some opportunistic infections can be prevented.\nPrimary prophylaxis\nFor HIV infected patients who have not previously contracted an opportunistic infection, in order to prevent the\ndevelopment of some opportunistic infections.\nPage 27 9/ 409\nInfections Primary prophylaxis\nPneumocystosis co-trimoxazole PO\nCerebral toxoplasmosis Children: 50 mg SMX + 10 mg TMP/kg once daily\nIsosporiasis Adults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP once daily\nVarious bacterial infections\nMalaria\nSecondary prophylaxis\nFor patients who develop a specific opportunistic infection, in order to prevent recurrence once treatment for the\ninfection is completed.\nInfections Secondary prophylaxis Comments\nPneumocystosis Alternative\ndapsone PO\nChildren: 2 mg/kg once daily (max. 100 mg\ndaily)\nAdults: 100 mg once daily\nco-trimoxazole PO\nToxoplasmosis Children: 50 mg SMX + 10 mg TMP/kg once Alternative\ndaily Adults:\nAdults: 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP once dapsone PO: 200 mg once weekly or 50\ndaily mg once daily\n+ pyrimethamine PO: 75 mg once weekly\n+ folinic acid PO: 25 to 30 mg once\nweekly\nIsosporiasis \u2013\nPenicilliosis itraconazole PO\n\u2013\nHistoplasmosis Adults: 200 mg once daily\nCryptococcal meningitis fluconazole PO\nChildren: 6 mg/kg once daily \u2013\nAdults: 200 mg once daily\nOral or oesophageal fluconazole PO Only for frequent and severe recurrences\ncandidiasis Children: 3 to 6 mg/kg once daily\nAdults: 100 to 200 mg once daily\nHerpes simplex aciclovir PO Only for frequent and severe recurrences\nChildren under 2 years: 200 mg 2 times daily\nChildren 2 years and over and adults: 400 mg\n2 times daily\nPage 28 0/ 409\nPage 28 1/ 409\nDefinitions and\nSymptoms Diagnosis Treatment\naetiologies\nDiarrhoea Diarrhoea is defined as at 1.

It usually responds to\ncorticosteroids.\nSecondary NS is associated with infectious diseases (e.g. post-infectious glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, hepatitis B\nand C, HIV infection, malaria, and schistosomiasis) and may respond to treatment of the underlying cause.\nChildren with NS are at increased risk of thromboembolism, severe bacterial infections (in particular, due to S.\npneumoniae) and malnutrition. Untreated NS may progress to renal failure.\nClinical features\nTypically, the child presents with soft, pitting and painless oedema, which varies in location based on position and\nactivity. Upon awaking, the child has periorbital or facial oedema, which over the day decreases as oedema of the\nlegs increases.\nAs oedema worsens, it may localize to the back or genitals, or become generalized with ascites and pleural\neffusions.\nThis oedema should be differentiated from the oedema of severe acute malnutrition (SAM): in SAM, the child\npresents with bilateral pitting oedema of the feet and lower legs that does not vary with position. Oedema extends\nupwards to hands and face in severe cases. It is usually associated with typical skin and hair changes (see\nKwashiorkor: Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter 1).\nOnce SAM is excluded, the following two criteria must be met to make a clinical diagnosis of primary NS:\nPresence of heavy proteinuria,\nand\nAbsence of associated infections: see Hepatitis B and C and HIV infection (Chapter 8), Malaria and\nSchistosomiases (Chapter 6).\nLaboratory\nUrine\nMeasure protein with urinary dipstick on three separate voided urine samples (first voided urine if possible). In NS,\nproteinuria is equal or greater than +++ or equal or greater than 300 mg/dl or 30 g/litre a . NS is excluded if heavy\nproteinuria is not consistently present.\nIn case of macroscopic haematuria, or microscopic haematuria \u2265 +, consider glomerulonephritis.\nBlood tests (if available)\nSerum albumin concentration less than 30 g/litre and hyperlipidaemia.\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine most often in the normal range.\nPerform all necessary laboratory tests to exclude secondary NS.\nTreatment\nHospitalize the child for initial therapy.\nCorticosteroids (prednisolone or prednisone) are indicated in primary NS.\nBefore starting corticosteroid treatment:\nTreat any concomitant acute infections such as pneumonia, peritonitis, sepsis, pharyngitis, or cellulitis.\nPage 29 5/ 409\nExclude active tuberculosis and/or start antituberculous treatment.\nCorticosteroid treatment\nSee algorithm below. Total length of initial treatment is 2 to 4 months.\nNutrition, fluid intake, nursing and follow-up\nNo salt-added diet.\nDo not restrict fluids (risk of thrombosis due to hypercoagulability). If oedema is very severe, fluids may initially\nbe restricted (e.g. 75% of usual intake) while monitoring urine output.\nEncourage child to walk and play to prevent thromboembolism.\nDischarge child when stable, follow-up at least monthly, more frequently if indicated, weight and urine dipstick at\neach visit.\nInstruct the parent to continue no salt-added diet and to seek medical advice in case of fever, abdominal pain,\nrespiratory distress or signs of thromboembolism.\nManagement of infections\nTreat infections as soon as they appear but do not routinely give prophylactic antibiotics.\nImmunization\nChildren under 5 years: check that the child has received all EPI vaccines including Haemophilus influenzae type\nB, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine and (if in an endemic area) meningococcal A conjugate vaccine. If not,\nadminister catch-up vaccines.\nChildren over 5 years: check that the child has received tetanus, measles, pneumococcal conjugate and (if in an\nendemic area) meningococcal A conjugate vaccine. If not, administer catch-up vaccines.\nManagement of complications\nIntravascular volume depletion potentially leading to shock, present despite oedematous appearance\nPage 29 6/ 409\nSigns include decreased urine output with any one of the following: capillary refill \u2265 3 seconds, poor skin\nperfusion/mottling, cold extremities, low blood pressure.\nIf signs are present, administer human albumin 5% IV: 1 g/kg. If albumin is not available, administer Ringer\nlactate or 0.9% sodium chloride: 10 ml/kg over 30 minutes.\nIf signs of shock are present, see Shock, Chapter 1.\nRespiratory distress due to severe oedema (rare)\nThis is the only situation in which diuretics should be used and only if there are no signs of intravascular volume\ndepletion or after hypovolaemia has been corrected:\nfurosemide PO: 0.5 mg/kg 2 times daily\nIf not effective, discontinue furosemide. If creatinine is normal, administer spironolactone PO: 1 mg/kg 2 times\ndaily. The dose can be increased to 9 mg/kg daily in resistant cases of ascites.\nWhile on diuretics, monitor for dehydration, thromboembolism and hypokalaemia.\nSpecialized advice and management (including further investigations such as renal biopsy) are required:\nIn children less than 1 year or more than 10 years,\nIn case of steroid resistant NS,\nIn case of mixed nephrotic and nephritic clinical picture.\nIn case of steroid-resistant NS, when referral is impossible and as a last resort, the following palliative measure may\nreduce proteinuria and delay renal failure:\nenalapril PO: 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg 2 times daily (start with the lowest dose and increase gradually if necessary until\nreduction of proteinuria). If available, monitor for hyperkalaemia.\nThis is a palliative measure and the prognosis for steroid-resistant NS is poor in the absence of specialized treatment.\nFootnotes\n(a) Nephrotic range proteinuria in children is defined as urinary protein excretion greater than 50 mg/kg daily. Quantitative\nmeasurement of protein excretion is normally based on a timed 24-hour urine collection. However, if this test cannot be\nperformed, urine dipstick measurements can be substituted.\nPage 29 7/ 409\nUrolithiasis\nLast updated: December 2020\nUrolithiasis is the formation and passage of calculi (stones) in the urinary tract.\nClinical features\nMany calculi do not cause symptoms; they may be found incidentally through radiology exams.\nSymptoms arise when calculi cause partial or complete obstruction and/or infection:\nIntermittent, acute flank to pelvic pain (renal colic). Pain can be severe and typically causes nausea and vomiting.\nAbdomen/flank may be tender to palpation. Patients are typically restless, finding no comfortable position.\nHaematuria and/or gravel (calculi) passed in urine.\nFever and signs of pyelonephritis if secondary infection develops (see Acute pyelonephritis, Chapter 9).\nNote: if available, ultrasound may demonstrate calculi and hydronephrosis.\nTreatment\nEncourage the patient to drink fluids.\nAdminister analgesics according to the intensity of pain (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nIn case of secondary infection: antibiotic treatment as for pyelonephritis. The effectiveness will depend on the\npassage of calculi.\nNote: the majority of calculi pass spontaneously. If there are signs of significant renal dysfunction or secondary\ninfection that does not improve with antibiotic treatment, consider surgical referral.\nPage 29 8/ 409\nAcute cystitis\nLast updated: July 2021\nCystitis is an infection of the bladder and urethra that affects mainly women and girls from 2 years of age. Escherichia\ncoli is the causative pathogen in at least 70% of cases. Other pathogens include Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus sp,\nKlebsiella sp and in young women, Staphylococcus saprophyticus.\nClinical features\nBurning pain on urination and urinary urgency and frequency; in children: crying when passing urine; involuntary loss of\nurine.\nAND\nNo fever (or mild fever), no flank pain; no systemic signs and symptoms in children.\nIt is essential to rule out pyelonephritis.\nThe symptom 'burning pain on urination' alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis. See Abnormal vaginal discharge.\nInvestigations\nUrine dipstick test:\nPerform dipstick analysis for nitrites (which indicate the presence of enterobacteria) and leukocytes (which indicate\nan inflammation) in the urine.\nIf dipstick analysis is positive for nitrites and/or leukocytes, a urinary infection is likely.\nIn women, if dipstick analysis is negative for both nitrites and leukocytes, a urinary infection is excluded.\nMicroscopy/culture: when a dipstick analysis is positive, it is recommended to carry out urine microscopy/culture in\norder to confirm the infection and identify the causative pathogen, particularly in children and pregnant women.\nWhen urine microscopy is not feasible, an empirical antibiotherapy should be administered to patients with typical\nsigns of cystitis and positive dipstick urinalysis (leukocytes and/or nitrites).\nNote: aside of these results, in areas where urinary schistosomiasis is endemic, consider schistosomiasis in patients\nwith macroscopic haematuria or microscopic haematuria detected by dipstick test, especially in children from 5 to 15\nyears, even if the patient may suffer from concomitant bacterial cystitis.\nPOCUS a : in cases of recurrent cystitis, perform FAST views to evaluate for signs of urinary tract pathologies.\nTreatment\nCystitis in girls \u2265 2 years\ncefixime PO: 8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days\nor\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO (dose expressed in amoxicillin): 12.5 mg/kg 2 times daily for 3 days\nCystitis in young, nonpregnant women\nIf dipstick analysis is positive for both nitrites and leukocytes:\nfosfomycin-trometamol PO: 3 g single dose\nor\nnitrofurantoin PO: 100 mg 3 times daily for 5 days\nPage 29 9/ 409\nIf dipstick analysis is negative for nitrites but positive for leukocytes, the infection may be due to S. saprophyticus.\nFosfomycin is not active against this pathogen. Use nitrofurantoin as above.\nWhatever the antibiotic used, symptoms may persist for 2 to 3 days despite adequate treatment.\nIn the event of treatment failure (or recurrent cystitis i.e. > 3-4 episodes per year), ciprofloxacin PO: 500 mg 2\ntimes daily for 3 days\nFor patients with recurrent cystitis, consider bladder stones, urinary schistosomiasis, urinary tuberculosis or\ngonorrhoea (examine the partner).\nCystitis in pregnant or lactating women\nfosfomycin-trometamol PO: 3 g single dose\nor\nnitrofurantoin PO (contraindicated in the last month of pregnancy): 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days\nor\ncefixime PO: 200 mg 2 times daily for 5 days\nFootnotes\n(a) POCUS should only be performed and interpreted by trained clinicians.\nPage 30 0/ 409\nAcute pyelonephritis\nPyelonephritis is an infection of the renal parenchyma, more common in women than in men.\nThe pathogens causing pyelonephritis are the same as those causing cystitis (see Acute cystitis, Chapter 9).\nPyelonephritis is potentially severe, especially in pregnant women, neonates and infants.\nManagement depends on the presence of signs of severity or complications or risk of complications.\nClinical features\nNeonates and infant\nSymptoms are not specific: fever, irritability, vomiting, poor oral intake. Palpation of the lower abdomen may show\nabdominal tenderness. The absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis. On the other hand, fever \u2013with no\nobvious cause\u2013 may be the only manifestation.\nNeonates may present with fever or hypothermia, altered general condition, altered conscious state, pale/grey\ncolour, shock.\nIn practice, a urinary tract infection should be suspected in children with unexplained fever or septic syndrome with no\nobvious focus of infection.\nOlder children and adults\nSigns of cystitis (burning pain on urination and urinary urgency and frequency, etc.)\nAND\nFever > 38 \u00b0C and unilateral flank pain or abdominal tenderness\nNausea and/or vomiting are common.\nLaboratory\nSee Acute cystitis, Chapter 9.\nTreatment\nCriteria for hospital admission:\nPatients at risk of complications: children, pregnant women, men a , functional or structural abnormality of the\nurinary tract (lithiasis, malformation, etc.), severe immunodeficiency;\nPatients with complicated pyelonephritis: urinary tract obstruction, renal abscess, emphysematous\npyelonephritis in diabetic patients;\nPatients with signs of severe infection: sepsis (infection with signs of organ dysfunction) and septic shock,\ndehydration or nausea/vomiting preventing hydration and oral treatment;\nNo clinical improvement 24 hours after the start of oral antibiotherapy in women treated as outpatients.\nAntibiotherapy in children\nChildren under one month\nampicillin slow IV (3 minutes) for 7 to 10 days\nChildren 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 12 hours\nChildren 0 to 7 days (\u2265 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 8 hours\nChildren 8 days to < 1 month: 50 mg/kg every 8 hours\n+ gentamicin slow IV (3 minutes) for 5 days\nChildren 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 3 mg/kg once daily\nPage 30 1/ 409\nChildren 0 to 7 days (\u2265 2 kg): 5 mg/kg once daily\nChildren 8 days to < 1 month: 5 mg/kg once daily\nor\ncefotaxime slow IV (3 minutes) for 7 to 10 days\nChildren 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 12 hours\nChildren 0 to 7 days (\u2265 2 kg): 50 mg/kg every 8 hours\nChildren 8 days to < 1 month: 50 mg/kg every 8 hours\nChildren one month and over\nceftriaxone IM or slow IV b (3 minutes): 50 mg/kg once daily until the child's condition improves (at least 3 days)\nthen change to oral route to complete 10 days of treatment with:\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO (dose expressed in amoxicillin)\nChildren < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nChildren \u2265 40 kg:\nRatio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily)\nRatio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily)\nAntibiotherapy in adults [1]\nUncomplicated pyelonephritis\nceftriaxone IM: 1 g single dose or gentamicin IM: 5 mg/kg single dose\n+\nciprofloxacin PO: 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days\nor\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO (dose expressed in amoxicillin) for 10 to 14 days\nRatio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily)\nRatio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily)\nor\ncefixime PO: 200 mg 2 times daily or 400 mg once daily for 10 to 14 days\nPyelonephritis with criteria for hospital admission\nampicillin slow IV (3 minutes): 2 g every 6 hours for at least 3 days + gentamicin IM: 5 mg/kg once daily for 3\ndays\nthen change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO (or another antibiotic depending on the antibiotic susceptibility\ntest) to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment\nor\nceftriaxone IV b : 1 g once daily for at least 3 days + gentamicin IM: 5 mg/kg once daily for 3 days in the event\nof sepsis then change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO (or another antibiotic depending on the antibiotic\nsusceptibility test) to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment\nPreferably use the combination ampicillin + gentamicin to cover enterococci.\nPyelonephritis with abscess formation or emphysematous pyelonephritis may require longer antibiotherapy.\nTreatment of fever and pain: do not administer NSAID (Fever, Chapter 1).\nMaintain proper hydration (1.5 litres daily in adults), especially in children (risk of dehydration); treat dehydration if\npresent (see Dehydration, Chapter 1).\nManagement of septic shock if needed.\nFootnotes\n(a) Pyelonephritis is rare in men; bacterial prostatitis should be suspected in the event of febrile urinary tract infection.\nPage 30 2/ 409\n(b) The solvent of ceftriaxone for IM injection contains lidocaine.

Some tests may help in diagnosing vaginal and\nurethral discharge, but they should never delay treatment (results should be available within one hour).\nThe patient should be treated at his/her first encounter with the health care provider (no patient should be sent\nhome without treatment, e.g. while waiting for laboratory results).\nSingle dose regimens are preferred when indicated.\nIn the case of urethral discharge, abnormal vaginal discharge (except candidiasis), genital ulcers (except herpes) and\nsexually transmitted upper genital tract infection, the sexual partner should receive a treatment. In the case of\ncandidiasis, genital herpes and venereal warts, the partner is treated only if symptomatic.\nPatients with sexually transmitted infections should receive information on their disease(s) and treatment and be\ncounselled on risk reduction and HIV testing. Condoms should be provided for the duration of treatment.\nSpecial situation: sexual violence\nPage 30 5/ 409\nTaking into consideration the physical, psychological, legal and social consequences of sexual violence, medical\ncare is not limited to the diagnosis and treatment of genital lesions or infections.\nCare includes listening to the victim\u2019s story, a complete physical examination, laboratory tests if available, and\ncompletion of a medical certificate.\nDuring the consultation, prophylactic or curative treatments must be proposed to the patient.\nProphylactic treatment:\npriority is given to:\na) the risk of HIV transmission. Start antiretroviral therapy as early as possible if the patient is seen within 48-\n72 hours after exposure (see HIV infection and AIDS, Chapter 8);\nb) the risk of pregnancy resulting from rape. Administer emergency contraception as soon as possible, ideally\nwithin 72 hours after the rape c :\nlevonorgestrel PO, one 1.5 mg tablet single dose (including in women receiving HIV post-exposure\nprophylaxis); double the dose (3 mg) only if the patient was already taking an enzyme-inducing drug (e.g.\nrifampicin, carbamazepine, certain antiretrovirals) before the rape;\nor ulipristal PO, one 30 mg tablet single dose;\nor a copper intrauterine device (except in case of active genital infection);\nprevention of sexually transmitted infections: a single dose of azithromycin PO 2 g + ceftriaxone IM 500 mg\n(or, if ceftriaxone is not available, cefixime PO 400 mg). If necessary, treatment of trichomoniasis may be\nstarted later than the other treatments (tinidazole or metronidazole PO, 2 g single dose);\ntetanus prophylaxis and/or vaccination (see Tetanus, Chapter 7) if there are any wounds;\nvaccination against hepatitis B (accelerated vaccination schedule, see Viral hepatitis, Chapter 8).\nCurative treatment:\nof any related pathologies/infections if the assault is not recent.\nof wounds,\nMental health care is necessary irrespective of any delay between the event and the patient arriving for a consultation.\nCare is based on immediate attention (one-on-one reception and listening) and if necessary, follow-up care with a view\nto detecting and treating any psychological and/or psychiatric sequelae (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress\ndisorder, etc.). See Chapter 11.\nFootnotes\n(a) GI may be sexually transmitted (e.g. gonorrhoea, chlamydia) or not (e.g. most cases of candidiasis).\n(b) Keep in mind that in Schistosoma haematobium endemic areas, genital symptoms may also be due to, or associated with,\ngenitourinary schistosomiasis (see Schistosomiasis, Chapter 6).\n(c) Nevertheless, between 72 and 120 hours (5 days) after the rape, emergency contraception is still sufficiently effective to be\nadministered.\nPage 30 6/ 409\nUrethral discharge\nLast updated: August 2022\nUrethral discharge is seen almost exclusively in men. The principal causative organisms are Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n(gonorrhoea) and Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia).\nAbnormal discharge should be confirmed by performing a clinical examination a . In males, the urethra should be milked\ngently if no discharge is visible. Furthermore, specifically check for urethral discharge in patients complaining of painful\nor difficult urination (dysuria).\nCase management\nLaboratory\nC. trachomatis cannot easily be identified in a field laboratory. In the absence of validated rapid diagnostic tests,\nthe treatment is empiric.\nIn men, a methylene blue or Gram stained smear from a urethral swab may be used to detect gonococci (Gram\nnegative intracellular diplococci).\nTreatment of the patient\nIn women: same treatment as cervicitis.\nIn men:\nIf microscopy of a urethral smear has been performed: in the absence of gonococci, treat for chlamydia alone;\nin the presence of gonococci, treat for chlamydia AND gonorrhoea.\nWhen no laboratory is available, treat for chlamydia AND gonorrhoea as below:\nPage 30 7/ 409\nTreatment for chlamydia Treatment for gonorrhoea\nazithromycin PO: 1 g single dose PLUS ceftriaxone IM: 500 mg single dose\nor or, if ceftriaxone is not available,\ndoxycycline PO: 100 mg 2 times daily for cefixime PO: 400 mg single dose\n7 days\nIf urethral discharge persists or reappears after 7 days:\nVerify that the patient has received an effective treatment (i.e. one of the combinations above).\nGonococcal resistance is a possibility if another treatment (e.g. co-trimoxazole or kanamycin) has been\nadministered: re-treat for gonorrhoea as above (chlamydia is rarely resistant).\nIf an effective antibiotic therapy has been given, consider trichomoniasis (tinidazole or metronidazole PO, 2 g\nsingle dose); also consider reinfection.\nTreatment of the partner\nThe sexual partner receives the same treatment as the patient, whether or not symptoms are present.\nFootnotes\n(a) In areas where lymphatic filariasis is endemic, be careful not to confuse purulent urethral discharge with milky or rice-water\nurine (chyluria) suggestive of lymphatic filariasis.\nPage 30 8/ 409\nAbnormal vaginal discharge\nLast updated: August 2022\nAbnormal vaginal discharge is defined as discharge that is different from usual with respect to\ncolour/odour/consistency (e.g. discoloured or purulent or malodorous).\nAbnormal discharge is often associated with vulvar pruritus or pain with intercourse (dyspareunia), or painful or difficult\nurination (dysuria) or lower abdominal pain. Routinely check for abnormal vaginal discharge in women presenting with\nthese symptoms.\nAbnormal vaginal discharge may be a sign of infection of the vagina (vaginitis) and/or the cervix (cervicitis) or upper\ngenital tract infection.\nAbnormal discharge must be clinically confirmed: inspection of the vulva, speculum exam checking for cervical/vaginal\ninflammation or discharge.\nAbdominal and bimanual pelvic examinations should be performed routinely in all women presenting with vaginal\ndischarge to rule out upper genital tract infection (lower abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness).\nThe principal causative organisms are:\nIn vaginitis: Gardnerella vaginalis and other bacteria (bacterial vaginosis), Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis)\nand Candida albicans (candidiasis).\nIn cervicitis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) and Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia).\nIn upper genital tract infections: see Upper genital tract infections.\nCase management\nPage 30 9/ 409\nCervicitis may be difficult to diagnose. When in doubt, administer treatment for cervicitis to women with abnormal\nvaginal discharge and any of the following risk factors:\nUrethral discharge in the partner\nContext of sexual violence or prostitution\nNew partner or more than one partner in the preceding 3 months\nLaboratory\nXpert molecular (PCR) tests are recommended for the detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoea.\nMicroscopic examination of a fresh wet smear may show mobile T. vaginalis, yeast cells and hyphae in candidiasis,\nand \u201cclue cells\u201d in bacterial vaginosis.\nIdentification of N. gonorrhoeae by Gram-stained smear is not sensitive in women and is not recommended.\nTreatment of the patient\nCervicitis\nTreat for both chlamydia AND gonorrhoea.\nPage 31 0/ 409\nTreatment for chlamydia Treatment for gonorrhoea\nNon-pregnant women\nazithromycin PO: 1 g single dose PLUS ceftriaxone IM: 500 mg single dose\nor or, if not available,\ndoxycycline PO: 100 mg 2 times daily cefixime PO: 400 mg single dose\nfor 7 days\nPregnant women\nazithromycin PO: 1 g single dose PLUS ceftriaxone IM: 500 mg single dose\nor or, if not available,\nerythromycin PO: 1 g 2 times daily cefixime PO: 400 mg single dose\nor 500 mg 4 times daily for 7 days\nBacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis\ntinidazole PO: 2 g single dose\nor metronidazole PO: 2 g single dose\nIn the case of treatment failure:\ntinidazole PO: 500 mg 2 times daily for 5 days\nor metronidazole PO: 400 to 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days\nVulvovaginal candidiasis\nclotrimazole (500 mg vaginal tab): 1 tablet inserted deep into the vagina at bedtime, single dose\nIf the patient has extensive vulvar involvement, miconazole 2% cream (one application to the vulva 2 times daily for 7\ndays) may be used in combination with the intravaginal treatment above. Miconazole cream may complement, but\ndoes not replace, treatment with clotrimazole.\nTreatment of the partner\nWhen the patient is treated for vaginitis or cervicitis, the partner receives the same treatment as the patient, whether\nor not symptoms are present.\nIn the case of vulvovaginal candidiasis, the partner is treated only if symptomatic (itching and redness of the\nglans/prepuce): miconazole 2% cream, one application 2 times daily for 7 days.\nPage 31 1/ 409\nGenital ulcers\nGenital ulcers, defined as single or multiple vesicular, ulcerative or erosive lesions of the genital tract, with or without\ninguinal lymphadenopathy, should lead to consideration of sexually transmitted infection.\nThe principal causative organisms are Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid) and Herpes\nsimplex (genital herpes).

Antibiotic choices are directed by the most\ncommon pathogens in each scenario.\nIf peritonitis or pelvic abscess is suspected, request a surgical opinion while initiating antibiotic therapy.\nClinical features\nSexually transmitted infections\nDiagnosis may be difficult, as clinical presentation is variable.\nSuggestive symptoms are: abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, fever, dyspareunia, menometrorrhagia,\ndysuria.\nInfection is probable when one or more of the above symptoms are associated with one or more of the following\nsigns: cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, tender abdominal mass.\nInfections after childbirth or abortion\nMost cases present with a typical clinical picture, developing within 2 to 10 days after delivery (caesarean section\nor vaginal delivery) or abortion (spontaneous or induced):\nFever, generally high\nAbdominal or pelvic pain\nMalodorous or purulent lochia\nEnlarged, soft and/or tender uterus\nCheck for retained placenta.\nIn the early stages, fever may be absent or moderate and abdominal pain may be mild.\nTreatment\nCriteria for hospitalisation include:\nClinical suspicion of severe or complicated infection (e.g. peritonitis, abscess, septicaemia)\nDiagnostic uncertainty (e.g. suspicion of extra-uterine pregnancy, appendicitis)\nSignificant obstacles to ambulatory oral treatment\nNo improvement after 48 hours, or deterioration within 48 hours, of outpatient treatment\nAll other patients may be treated on an ambulatory basis. They should be reassessed routinely on the third day of\ntreatment to evaluate clinical improvement (decrease in pain, absence of fever). If it is difficult to organise routine\nfollow-up, advise patients to return to clinic if there is no improvement after 48 hours of treatment, or sooner if their\ncondition is worsening.\nSexually transmitted infections\nAntibiotic therapy combines 3 antibiotics to cover the most frequent causative organisms: gonococci, chlamydiae,\nand anaerobes.\nAmbulatory treatment:\ncefixime PO: 400 mg single dose or ceftriaxone IM: 500 mg single dose\nPage 31 6/ 409\n+ doxycycline PO: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days a\n+ metronidazole PO: 500 mg 2 times daily for 14 days\nTreatment in hospital:\nceftriaxone IM or IV b : 1 g once daily\n+ doxycycline PO: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days a\n+ metronidazole PO or IV infusion: 500 mg 2 times daily for 14 days\nContinue triple therapy for 24 to 48 hours after signs and symptoms have improved (resolution of fever,\ndecrease in pain), then continue doxycycline (or erythromycin) + metronidazole to complete 14 days of\ntreatment.\nIf an IUD is in place, it should be removed (offer another method of contraception).\nAnalgesic treatment according to pain intensity.\nTreatment of the partner: single dose treatment for both gonorrhoea AND chlamydia (as for Urethral discharge),\nwhether or not symptoms are present.\nInfections after childbirth or abortion\nAntibiotic therapy: treatment must cover the most frequent causative organisms: anaerobes, Gram negatives and\nstreptococci.\nAmbulatory treatment (early stages only):\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) PO for 7 days\nUse formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively.

Ceftriaxone reconstituted using this solvent must never be\nadministered by IV route. For IV administration, water for injection must always be used.\nPage 31 7/ 409\nVenereal warts\nVenereal warts are benign tumours of the skin or mucous membranes due to certain papilloma viruses (HPV).\nClinical features\nVenereal warts are soft, raised, painless growths, sometimes clustered (cauliflower- like appearance) or macules\n(flat warts), which are more difficult to discern. Warts can be external (vulva, penis, scrotum, perineum, anus) and/or\ninternal (vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum; oral cavity in HIV infected patients).\nIn women, the presence of external warts is an indication for a speculum examination to exclude vaginal or cervical\nwarts. Speculum exam may reveal a friable, fungating tumour on the cervix, suggestive of cancer associated with\npapilloma virus a .\nTreatment\nChoice of treatment depends on the size and location of the warts. Treatment may be less effective, and relapses\nmore frequent, in HIV infected patients.\nExternal warts < 3 cm and vaginal warts\npodophyllotoxin 0.5% b solution may be self-applied by the patient, but in the event of vaginal warts, the treatment\nmust be applied by medical staff.\nExplain the procedure to the patient: apply the solution to the warts using an applicator or cotton bud, sparing the\nsurrounding healthy skin, allow to air dry. On vaginal warts, the solution should be allowed to dry before the speculum is\nwithdrawn.\nApply the solution 2 times daily, 3 consecutive days per week, for up to 4 weeks.\nPodophyllum preparations are contra-indicated in pregnant c or breastfeeding women. They should not be applied on\ncervical, intra-urethral, rectal, oral or extensive warts. Improper use may result in painful ulceration.\nExternal warts > 3 cm; cervical, intra-urethral, rectal and oral warts; warts in pregnant or\nbreastfeeding women\nSurgical excision or cryotherapy or electrocoagulation.\nFootnotes\n(a) Certain types of HPV may cause cancer. Presence of genital warts in women is an indication to screen for precancerous\nlesions of the cervix, if feasible in the context (visual inspection with acetic acid, or cervical smear, or other available\ntechniques), and to treat any lesions identified (cryotherapy, conisation, etc., according to diagnosis).\n(b) Podophyllum 10%, 15% or 25% resin is another preparation which is much more caustic, and should be applied only by\nmedical staff. Protect the surrounding skin (vaseline or zinc oxide ointment) before applying the resin. Wash off with soap\nand water after 1 to 4 hours. Apply once weekly for 4 weeks.\n(c) Treatment of warts is not an emergency and may be deferred if alternatives to podophyllum preparations are not available.\nGenital warts are not an indication for caesarean section: it is uncommon for warts to interfere with delivery, and the risk of\nmother-to-child transmission is very low.\nPage 31 8/ 409\nMajor genital infections (summary)\nLast updated: July 2021\nPage 31 9/ 409\nPathogens/\nClinical features Investigations Treatment\nInfections\nNeisseria In women: Best method is PCR ceftriaxone IM: 500 mg\ngonorrhoeae vaginal discharge, cervicitis (Xpert), if available. single dose\n(gonorrhoea) (mucopurulent cervical discharge), In men (not sensitive or, if not available,\ndysuria (50% of infections are enough in women): Gram cefixime PO: 400 mg\nasymptomatic); or methylene blue stain: single dose\nUGTI (salpingitis, endometritis). intracellular diplococci Treat also for\nIn men: purulent urethral discharge and polymorphonuclear chlamydia.\nand sometimes dysuria (5 to 50% of leukocytes (more than 4 In case of upper genital\ninfections are asymptomatic). per field). tract infection, see\nUGTI.\nChlamydia In women: The best method is PCR azithromycin PO: 1 g\ntrachomatis vaginal discharge, cervicitis, and (Xpert), if available. single dose\n(chlamydia) rarely dysuria (> 50% of or doxycycline PO (a) :\ninfections are asymptomatic); 200 mg daily for 7 days\nUGTI (salpingitis, endometritis).

The procedure includes cleaning, disinfection and protection\nof the wound while respecting the rules of hygiene.\nNot all wounds need to be covered by a dressing (e.g. a clean wound that has been sutured for several days; a small\ndry wound not requiring sutures).\nEquipment\nSterile instruments\nOne Kocher or Pean forceps\nOne dissecting forceps\nOne pair of surgical scissors or one scalpel to excise necrotic tissue and to cut gauze or sutures\nInstruments for one dressing for one patient must be wrapped together in paper or fabric (or can be placed in a metallic\nbox) and sterilised together to limit handling and breaks in asepsis. 5 to 10 compresses may be included in this set.\nIf there are no sterile instruments, a dressing can be done using sterile gloves.\nRenewable supplies\nSterile compresses\nNon-sterile disposable gloves\nAdhesive tape and/or crepe or gauze bandage\nSterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water\nDepending on the wound: antiseptic (7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution, 10% povidone iodine dermal solution),\nparaffin compresses, analgesics\nOrganisation of care\nProper organization of care helps maintain the rules of asepsis and decreases the risk of contamination of the wound\nor transmission of organisms from one patient to another:\nAssign one room for dressings. It must be cleaned and the waste removed every day. The dressing table must be\ndisinfected after each patient.\nDressings may be applied at the bedside if the patient\u2019s condition requires. Use a clean, disinfected dressing trolley\nwith: on the upper tray, sterile and/or clean material (dressing set, extra compresses, etc.) and on the lower tray,\nseptic material (container for contaminated instruments, sharps disposal container and a container or garbage bag\nfor waste).\nPrepare all the necessary material in a well lit area. If necessary, arrange for an assistant to be present.\nWear protective glasses if there is a risk of projection from an oozing wound.\nAlways proceed from clean to dirty: start with patients with uninfected wounds. If there are multiple dressings for\none patient, start with the cleanest wound.\nTechnique\nIf the procedure may be painful, give an analgesic and wait the necessary time for the drug to take effect before\nstarting the procedure.\nSettle the patient comfortably in an area where his privacy is respected throughout the procedure.\nExplain the procedure to the patient and obtain his co-operation.\nInstruments (or sterile gloves) must be changed between patients.\nPage 32 6/ 409\nTo prevent drug interactions, use the same antiseptic for all care of one patient.\nRemoval of an old dressing\nWash hands (ordinary soap) or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub.\nPut on non-sterile gloves and remove the adhesive tape, bandage and superficial compresses.\nProceed gently with the last compresses. If they stick to the wound, loosen them with 0.9% sodium chloride or\nsterile water before removal.\nObserve the soiled compresses. If there is significant discharge, a greenish colour or a foul odour, a wound infection\nis likely.\nDiscard the dressing and the non-sterile gloves in the waste container.\nObserve the wound\nIn the case of an open wound, loss of cutaneous tissue or ulcer, the colour is an indicator of the stage in the healing\nprocess:\nblack area = necrosis, wet or dry infected eschar\nyellow or greenish area = infected tissue and presence of pus\nred area = granulation, usually a sign of healing (unless there is hypertrophy), however, red edges indicate\ninflammation or infection\npink area = process of epithelisation, the final stage of healing that begins at the edges of the wound\nIn the case of a sutured wound, the existence of local signs of suppuration and pain requires the removal of one or\nmore sutures to avoid the infection spreading. Local signs include:\nred, indurated and painful edges\ndrainage of pus between the sutures, either spontaneously or when pressure is applied on either side of the\nwound\nlymphangitis\nsub-cutaneous crepitations around the wound\nIn any case, if local signs of infection are observed, look for general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the\noverall condition).\nTechnique for cleaning and dressing of the wound\nWash hands again or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub.\nOpen the dressing set or box after checking the date of sterilisation and that the wrapping is intact.\nPick up one of the sterile forceps being careful not to touch anything else.\nPick up the second forceps with the help of the first one.\nMake a swab by folding a compress in 4 using the forceps.\nClean sutured wound or clean open wound with red granulation:\nclean with 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water to remove any organic residue; work from the cleanest to the\ndirtiest area (use a clean swab for each stroke);\ndab dry with a sterile compress;\nre-cover a sutured wound with sterile compresses or an open wound with paraffin compresses; the dressing\nshould extend a few cm beyond the edges of the wound;\nkeep the dressing in place with adhesive tape or a bandage.\nNecrotic or infected open wounds:\nclean with povidone iodine (7.5% scrub solution, 1 part of solution + 4 parts of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or\nsterile water). Rinse thoroughly then dab dry with a sterile compress; or if not available, sterile 0.9% sodium\nchloride or sterile water and apply an antiseptic (10% povidone iodine dermal solution).\napply sterile vaseline and remove all necrotic tissue at each dressing change until the wound is clean.\nPage 32 7/ 409\nDiscard any sharp materials used in an appropriate sharps container and the rest of the waste in a waste container.\nAs quickly as possible, soak the instruments in disinfectant.\nWash hands again or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub.\nThe principles remain the same if the dressing is done using instruments or sterile gloves.\nSubsequent dressings\nClean, sutured wound: remove the initial dressing after 5 days if the wound remains painless and odourless, and if\nthe dressing remains clean. The decision to re-cover or to leave the wound uncovered (if it is dry) often depends on\nthe context and local practices.\nInfected, sutured wound: remove one or more sutures and evacuate the pus. Change the dressing at least once\ndaily.\nOpen, dirty wound: daily cleaning and dressing change.\nOpen granulating wound: change the dressing every 2 to 3 days, except if the granulation is hypertrophic (in this\ncase, apply local corticosteroids).\nPage 32 8/ 409\nTreatment of a simple wound\nA simple wound is a break in the continuity of the skin limited in depth at the sub-cutaneous fatty tissue, that does not\naffect the underlying structures (muscle, bone, joints, major arteries, nerves, tendons) and without significant loss of\ntissue.\nThe goal of treatment is to assure rapid healing of the wound without complications or sequelae. Several basic rules\napply:\nrapidly treat wounds, while maintaining the rules of asepsis and the order of the initial procedures: cleaning-\nexploration-excision;\nidentify wounds that need to be sutured and those for which suturing would be harmful or dangerous;\nimmediately suture recent, clean, simple wounds (less than 6 hours old) and delay suturing contaminated wounds\nand/or those more than 6 hours old;\nprevent local (abscess) or general (gas gangrene; tetanus) infections.\nEquipment\nInstruments\n(Figures 1a to 1d)\nOne dissecting forceps, one needle-holder, one pair of surgical scissors and one Pean or Kocher forceps are\nusually enough.\nOne or two other artery forceps, a pair of Farabeuf retractors and a scalpel may be useful for a contused or deep\nwound.\nInstruments to suture one wound for one patient must be packaged and sterilised together (suture box or set) to limit\nhandling and breaks in asepsis.\nRenewable supplies\nFor local anaesthesia: sterile syringe and needle; 1% lidocaine (without epinephrine)\nSterile gloves, fenestrated sterile towel\nSterile absorbable and non-absorbable sutures\nAntiseptic and supplies for dressings\nFor drainage: corrugated rubber drain or equivalent, nylon suture\nTechnique\nSettle the patient comfortably in an area with good lighting and ensure all the necessary material is prepared.\nExplain the procedure to the patient and ensure his co-operation.\nIf the patient is a young child, arrange to have an assistant hold the child if necessary.\nInitial cleaning\nWear suitable clothing: sterile gloves for all wounds and a gown and protective glasses if there is a risk of projection\nfrom a bleeding wound.\nStart by washing the wound, prolong the cleaning if the wound is particularly soiled. Use ordinary soap\nor 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\nIf necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\nPage 32 9/ 409\nIf the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition)\nsystemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\nWash hands and put on sterile gloves.\nDisinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\nCover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\nLocal anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the\nanaesthetic to take effect.\nProceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if\nnecessary, aided by an assistant.\nConsider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical\nexamination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in\norder to orient surgical exploration):\na wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\na wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\na wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons,\na wound close to a major artery may be an arterial wound even if it is no longer bleeding.\nLook for and remove any foreign bodies.\nIn the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\nThe goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\nThe wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised,\nirregular or extensive.\nLimit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\nSub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well\nvascularised tissue.\nImmediate suturing of a simple wound\nImmediate suturing may have serious consequences for the patient if precautions to prevent infection and promote\nhealing are not taken.\nThe decision to suture immediately can only be taken after the cleaning, exploration and satisfactory excision, and\nif the following conditions are met: simple wound, no more than 6 hours old with no devitalised or contused tissue\n(the wound may be as long as 24 hours old if on the face, scalp, upper limbs or hands).\nBites (for local treatment see Rabies, Chapter 8) and bullet, shell or mine shrapnel wounds should not be\nimmediately sutured.\nDelayed suturing of a simple wound\nWounds that do not fill the above conditions should not be immediately sutured.\nAfter cleaning, exploration and excision a simple dressing is applied to the open wound.\nFurther cleaning and removal of any remaining necrotic tissue is completed with daily dressing changes.\nIf after 72 hours there are no signs of local infection, the wound may be sutured.\nHealing by second intention of infected wounds\nPage 33 0/ 409\nIf the wound does not meet the conditions of cleanliness described above, the wound cannot be sutured. It will heal\neither spontaneously (healing by secondary intention), or will require a skin graft (once the wound is clean) if there is\nsignificant loss of tissue.\nFigures 1 : Basic instruments\nFigure 1a Figure 1b\nKocher forceps, Kelly forceps,\nstraight, toothed curved, non-toothed\nFigure 1c Figure 1d\nSmall artery forceps, Farabeuf retractors\ncurved, non-toothed\nFigures 2 : How to hold instruments\nPage 33 1/ 409\nFigure 2a\nAlways mount a surgical blade using a needle holder.\nChange the blade for each new procedure.\nFigure 2b\nDissecting forceps should not be held in the palm of the hand,\nbut rather between the thumb and index finger.\nToothed dissecting forceps should only be used on skin.\nFigure 2c\nInsert the thumb and the ring finger into the handle of a needle holder (or scissors), and stabilize the instrument using\nthe index finger.\nFigures 3 : Wound debridement\nThis should be done sparingly, limited to excision of severely contused or lacerated tissue that is clearly becoming\nnecrotic.\nPage 33 2/ 409\nFigure 3a\nDebridement of a contused, ragged wound: straightening of the wound edges with a scalpel.

They cause significant pain\nand may threaten survival and/or compromise function.\nClassification of burns\nSevere burns: one or more of the following parameters:\nInvolving more than 10% of the body surface area (BSA) in children and 15% in adults\nInhalation injury (smoke, hot air, particles, toxic gas, etc.)\nMajor concomitant trauma (fracture, head injury, etc.)\nLocation: face, hands, neck, genitalia/perineum, joints (risk of functional deficit)\nElectrical and chemical burns or burns due to explosions\nAge < 3 years or > 60 years or significant co-morbidities (e.g. epilepsy, malnutrition)\nMinor burns: involving less than 10% of the BSA in children and 15% in adults, in the absence of other risk factors\nEvaluation of burns\nExtent of burns\nLund-Browder table \u2013 Percentage of body surface area according to age\nPage 33 7/ 409\nLocation < 1 year 1-4 years 5-9 years 10-15 years Adults\nHead 19 17 13 10 7\nNeck 2 2 2 2 2\nAnterior trunk 13 13 13 13 13\nPosterior trunk 13 13 13 13 13\nRight buttock 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\nLeft buttock 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\nPerineum/genitalia 1 1 1 1 1\nRight upper arm 4 4 4 4 4\nLeft upper arm 4 4 4 4 4\nRight lower arm 3 3 3 3 3\nLeft lower arm 3 3 3 3 3\nRight hand 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\nLeft hand 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5\nRight thigh 5.5 6.5 8.5 8.5 9.5\nLeft thigh 5.5 6.5 8.5 8.5 9.5\nRight leg 5 5 5.5 6 7\nLeft leg 5 5 5.5 6 7\nRight foot 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5\nLeft foot 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5\nThis table helps to accurately calculate the % of BSA involved according to patient\u2019s age: e.g. burn of the face,\nanterior trunk, inner surface of the lower arm and circumferential burn of left upper arm in a child 2 years of age: 8.5 +\n13 + 1.5 + 4 = 27% BSA.\nDepth of burns\nPage 33 8/ 409\nApart from first-degree burns (painful erythema of the skin and absence of blisters) and very deep burns (third-degree\nburns, carbonization), it is not possible, upon initial examination, to determine the depth of burns. Differentiation is\npossible after D8-D10.\nSuperficial burn on D8-D10 Deep burn on D8-D10\nSensation Normal or pain Insensitive or diminished sensation\nColour Pink, blanches with pressure White, red, brown or black\nDoes not blanch with pressure\nTexture Smooth and supple Firm and leathery\nAppearance Minimal fibrinous exudate Covered with fibrinous exudate\nGranulation tissue evident Little or no bleeding when incised\nBleeds when incised\nHealing Heals spontaneously within 5- Very deep burn: always requires surgery (no\n15 days spontaneous healing)\nIntermediate burn: may heal spontaneously in 3 to 5\nweeks; high risk of infection and permanent sequelae\nEvaluation for the presence of inhalation injury\nDyspnoea with chest wall indrawing, bronchospasm, soot in the nares or mouth, productive cough, carbonaceous\nsputum, hoarseness, etc.\nTreatment of severe burns\nI. Initial management\nOn admission\nEnsure airway is patent; high-flow oxygen, even when SpO is normal.\n2\nEstablish IV access, through unburned skin if possible (intraosseous access if IV access is not possible).\nRinger lactate (RL): 20 ml/kg during the first hour, even if the patient is stable.\nMorphine SC: 0.2 mg/kg (Step 1 and Step 2 analgesics are not effective).\nIn the event of chemical burns: flush with copious amounts of water for 15 to 30 minutes, avoiding contamination of\nhealthy skin; do not attempt to neutralize the chemical agent.\nOnce the patient is stabilized\nRemove clothes if they are not adherent to the burn.\nTake history of the burn injury: mechanism, causative agent, time, etc.\nAssess the burn injury: extent, depth, carbonization; ocular burns, burns at risk of secondary functional deficits;\ncircumferential burns of the extremities, chest or neck. Wear face mask and sterile gloves during the examination.\nAssess for associated injuries (fractures, etc.).\nProtect the patient and keep him warm: clean/sterile sheet, survival blanket.\nInsert a urinary catheter if burns involve > 15% of BSA, and in the case of electrical burns or burns of the\nperineum/genitalia.\nPage 33 9/ 409\nInsert a nasogastric tube if burns involve > 20% of BSA (in the operating room while carrying out dressing\nprocedure).\nCalculate and initiate fluid and electrolyte requirements for the first 24 hours.\nIntensive monitoring: level of consciousness, heart rate, blood pressure, SpO , respiratory rate (RR) hourly;\n2\ntemperature and urine output every 4 hours.\nAdditional testing: haemoglobin, blood group, urine dipstick test.\nPrepare the patient for the first dressing procedure in the operating room.\nNotes:\nBurns do not bleed in the initial stage: check for haemorrhage if haemoglobin level is normal or low.\nBurns alone do not alter the level of consciousness. In the case if altered consciousness, consider head injury,\nintoxication, postictal state in epileptic patients.\nClinical manifestations of electrical burns vary significantly according to the type of current. Look for complications\n(arrhythmia, rhabdomyolysis, neurological disorders).\nII. General measures during the first 48 hours\nResuscitative measures\nIntravenous replacement fluid to correct hypovolaemia:\nFluid and electrolyte requirements during the first 48 hours according to age\nChildren < 12 years Children \u2265 12 years and adults\n0 - 8 h 2 ml/kg x % BSA of RL 2 ml/kg x % BSA of RL\n+ maintenance fluid (a) per hour x 8 h\n8 - 24 h 2 ml/kg x % BSA of RL 2 ml/kg x % BSA of RL\n+ maintenance fluid (a) per hour x 16 h\n24 - 48 h Daily maintenance IV fluid requirements (a) minus oral 40 ml/kg RL minus oral fluids (do not include\nfluids such as milk, broth, gavage feeds (do not drinking water in the calculation).\ninclude drinking water in the calculation).\n(a) Maintenance fluid: alternate RL and 5% glucose: 4 ml/kg/h for first 10 kg of body weight + 2 ml/kg/h for next 10 kg + 1\nml/kg/h for each additional kg (over 20 kg, up to 30 kg)\nNote: increase replacement volumes by 50% (3 ml/kg x % BSA for the first 8 hours) in the event of inhalation injury or\nelectrical burn. For burns > 50% BSA, limit the calculation to 50% BSA.\nThis formula provides a guide only and should be adjusted according to systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and urine\noutput. Avoid fluid overload. Reduce replacement fluid volumes if urine output exceeds the upper limit.\nTarget endpoints for IV replacement fluids\nPage 34 0/ 409\nNon-electrical burns Electrical burns\nChildren Children Children\nAll ages\n< 1 year 1-12 years > 12 years/adults\nAP (mmHg) SAP \u2265 60 SAP 70 to 90 + (2 x age) SAP \u2265 100 Age appropriate SAP\nUrine output 1 to 2 ml/kg/h 1 to 1.5 ml/kg/h 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/h 1 to 2 ml/kg/h\nIn patients with oliguria despite adequate fluid replacement:\ndopamine IV: 5 to 15 micrograms/kg/minute by IV pump\nor\nepinephrine IV: 0.1 to 0.5 micrograms/kg/minute by IV pump\nStop the infusion after 48 hours, if fluid requirements can be met by the oral route or gavage.\nRespiratory care\nIn all cases: continuous inhalation of humidified oxygen, chest physiotherapy.\nEmergency surgical intervention if necessary: tracheotomy, chest escharotomy.\nDo not administer corticosteroids (no effect on oedema; predisposition to infection). No specific treatment for\ndirect bronchopulmonary lesions.\nAnalgesia\nSee Pain management\nNutrition\nStart feeding early, beginning at H8:\nDaily needs in adults\ncalories: 25 kcal/kg + 40 kcal/% BSA\nproteins: 1.5 to 2 g/kg\nHigh energy foods (NRG5, Plumpy'nut, F100 milk) are necessary if the BSA is > 20% (normal food is inadequate).\nNutritional requirements are administered according to the following distribution: carbohydrates 50%, lipids 30%,\nproteins 20%.\nProvide 5-10 times the recommended daily intake of vitamins and trace elements.\nEnteral feeds are preferred: oral route or nasogastric tube (necessary if BSA > 20%).\nStart with small quantities on D1, then increase progressively to reach recommended energy requirements within 3\ndays.\nAssess nutritional status regularly (weigh 2 times weekly).\nReduce energy loss: occlusive dressings, warm environment (28-33 \u00b0C), early grafting; management of pain,\ninsomnia and depression.\nPatients at risk of rhabdomyolysis\nIn the event of deep and extensive burns, electrical burns, crush injuries to the extremities:\nMonitor for myoglobinuria: dark urine and urine dipstick tests.\nIf present: induce alkaline diuresis for 48 hours (20 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate per litre of RL) to obtain an\noutput of 1 to 2 ml/kg/hour. Do not administer dopamine or furosemide.\nInfection control\nPage 34 1/ 409\nPrecautions against infection are of paramount importance until healing is complete. Infection is one of the most\nfrequent and serious complications of burns:\nHygiene precautions (e.g. sterile gloves when handling patients).\nRigorous wound management (dressing changes, early excision).\nSeparate \u201cnew\u201d patients (< 7 days from burn) from convalescent patients (\u2265 7 days from burn).\nDo not administer antibiotherapy in the absence of systemic infection.\nInfection is defined by the presence of at least 2 of 4 following signs: temperature > 38.5 \u00b0C or < 36 \u00b0C,\ntachycardia, tachypnoea, elevation of white blood cell count by more than 100% (or substantial decrease in the\nnumber of white blood cells).\nIn the event of systemic infection, start empiric antibiotherapy:\ncefazolin IV\nChildren > 1 month: 25 mg/kg every 8 hours\nAdults : 2 g every 8 hours\n+ ciprofloxacin PO\nChildren > 1 month: 15 mg/kg 2 times daily\nAdults: 500 mg 3 times daily\nLocal infection, in the absence of signs of systemic infection, requires topical treatment with silver sulfadiazine. Not\nto be applied to children under 2 months.\nOther treatments\nOmeprazole IV from D1\nChildren: 1 mg/kg once daily\nAdults: 40 mg once daily\nTetanus vaccination (see Tetanus, Chapter 7).\nThromboprophylaxis: low molecular weight heparin SC beginning 48 to 72 hours post-injury.\nPhysiotherapy from D1 (prevention of contractures), analgesia is necessary.\nIntentional burns (suicide attempt, aggression): appropriate psychological follow-up.\nIII. Local treatment\nRegular dressing changes a prevent infection, decrease heat and fluid losses, reduce energy loss, and promote patient\ncomfort. Dressings should be occlusive, assist in relieving pain, permit mobilisation, and prevent contractures.\nBasic principles\nRigorous adherence to the principles of asepsis.\nDressing changes require morphine administration in the non-anaesthetised patient.\nThe first dressing procedure is performed in the operating room under general anaesthesia, the following in an\noperating room under general anaesthesia or at the bedside with morphine.\nTechnique\nAt the time of the first dressing procedure, shave any hairy areas (armpit, groin, pubis) if burns involve the adjacent\ntissues; scalp (anteriorly in the case of facial burns, entirely in the case of cranial burns). Cut nails.\nClean the burn with povidone iodine scrub solution (1 volume of 7.5% povidone iodine + 4 volumes of 0.9% sodium\nchloride or sterile water). Scrub gently with compresses, taking care to avoid bleeding.\nRemove blisters with forceps and scissors.\nRinse with 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water.\nDry the skin by blotting with sterile compresses.\nApply silver sulfadiazine directly by hand (wear sterile gloves) in a uniform layer of 3-5 mm to all burned areas\n(except eyelids and lips) to children 2 months and over and adults.\nPage 34 2/ 409\nApply a greasy dressing (Jelonet\u00ae or petrolatum gauze) using a back and forth motion (do not use a circular\nmovement).\nCover with a sterile compresses, unfolded into a single layer. Never encircle a limb with a single compress.\nWrap with a crepe bandage, loosely applied.\nElevate extremities to prevent oedema; immobilise in extension.\nFrequency\nRoutinely: every 48 hours.\nDaily in the event of superinfection or in certain areas (e.g. perineum).\nMonitoring\nDistal ischaemia of the burned limb is the main complication during the first 48 hours. Assess for signs of ischaemia:\ncyanosis or pallor of the extremity, dysaesthesia, hyperalgia, impaired capillary refill.\nMonitor daily: pain, bleeding, progression of healing and infection.\nIV. Surgical care\nEmergency surgical interventions\nEscharotomy: in the case of circumferential burns of arms, legs or fingers, in order to avoid ischaemia, and\ncircumferential burns of chest or neck that compromise respiratory movements.\nTracheotomy: in the event of airway obstruction due to oedema (e.g. deep cervicofacial burns). Tracheotomy can\nbe performed through a burned area.\nTarsorrhaphy: in the event of ocular or deep eyelid burns.\nSurgery for associated injuries (fractures, visceral lesions, etc.).\nBurn surgery\nExcision-grafting of deep burns, in the operating room, under general anaesthesia, between D5 and D6: excision of\nnecrotic tissue (eschar) with simultaneous grafting with autografts of thin skin. This intervention entails significant\nbleeding risk, do not involve more than 15% of BSA in the same surgery.\nIf early excision-grafting is not feasible, default to the process of sloughing-granulation-reepithelisation. Sloughing\noccurs spontaneously due to the action of sulfadiazine/ petrolatum gauze dressings and, if necessary, by\nmechanical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. This is followed by granulation, which may require surgical\nreduction in the case of hypertrophy. The risk of infection is high and the process is prolonged (> 1 month).\nV. Pain management\nAll burns require analgesic treatment. Pain intensity is not always predictable and regular assessment is paramount: use\na simple verbal scale (SVS) in children > 5 years and adults and NFCS or FLACC scales in children < 5 years (see Pain,\nChapter 1).\nMorphine is the treatment of choice for moderate to severe pain. Development of tolerance is common in burn\npatients and requires dose augmentation. Adjuvant treatment may complement analgesic medication (e.g. massage\ntherapy, psychotherapy).\nContinuous pain (experienced at rest)\nModerate pain:\nparacetamol PO + tramadol PO (see Pain, Chapter 1)\nModerate to severe pain:\nparacetamol PO + sustained release morphine PO (see Pain, Chapter 1)\nPage 34 3/ 409\nIn patients with severe burns, oral drugs are poorly absorbed in the digestive tract during the first 48 hours, morphine\nis administered by SC route.\nAcute pain experienced during care\nAnalgesics are given in addition to those given for continuous pain.\nSignificant medical interventions and extensive burns: general anaesthesia in an operating room.\nLimited non-surgical interventions (dressings, painful physiotherapy):\nMild to moderate pain, 60 to 90 minutes before giving care:\ntramadol PO (see Pain, Chapter 1) rarely allows treatment to be completed comfortably. In the event of\ntreatment failure, use morphine.\nModerate or severe pain, 60 to 90 minutes before giving care:\nimmediate release morphine PO: initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg; the effective dose is usually around 1 mg/kg,\nbut there is no maximum dose.\nor morphine SC: initial dose of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg; the effective dose is usually around 0.5 mg/kg, but there is no\nmaximum dose.\nNote: these doses of morphine are for adults, dosing is the same in children > 1 year, should be halved in children\nless than 1 year, and quartered in infants less than 3 months.\nPain management using morphine during dressing changes at the bedside requires:\nA trained nursing team.\nAvailability of immediate release oral morphine and naloxone.\nClose monitoring: level of consciousness, RR, heart rate, SpO , every 15 min for the first hour following dressing\n2\nchange, then routine monitoring.\nAssessment of pain intensity and sedation during the intervention and for 1 hour thereafter.\nNecessary equipment for ventilation by mask and manual suction.\nGentle handling of the patient at all times.\nAdjustment of morphine doses for subsequent dressings:\nIf pain intensity (SVS) is 0 or 1: continue with the same dose.\nIf SVS score \u2265 2: increase the dose by 25 to 50%. If pain control remains inadequate, the dressing change\nshould be carried out in the operating room under anaesthesia.\nTake advantage of the residual analgesia following dressing changes to carry out physiotherapy.\nAs a last resort (morphine unavailable and no facilities to give general anaesthesia), in a safe setting (trained staff,\nresuscitation equipment, recovery room), adding ketamine IM at analgesic doses (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) reinforces the\nanalgesic effect of the paracetamol + tramadol combination given before a dressing change.\nChronic pain (during the rehabilitation period)\nThe treatment is guided by self-evaluation of pain intensity, and utilises paracetamol and/or tramadol. Patients may\ndevelop neuropathic pain (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nAll other associated pain (physiotherapy, mobilization) should be treated as acute pain.\nMinor burns\nTreat as outpatients.\nWound care: dressings with silver sulfadiazine (to children 2 months and over and adults) or petrolatum gauze\n(except for first degree superficial burns).\nPain: paracetamol \u00b1 tramadol usually effective.\nPage 34 4/ 409\nFootnotes\n(a) Open technique \u00ab naked burn patient under a mosquito net \u00bb and water immersion therapy are obsolete and should no\nlonger be used.\nPage 34 5/ 409\nCutaneous abscess\nA cutaneous abscess is a collection of pus within the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.\nIt is most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus.\nClinical features\nPainful, red, shiny nodule with or without fluctuance; suppuration or surrounding cellulitis (see Erysipelas and cellulitis,\nChapter 4).\nRegional adenopathy and fever may be present.\nComplications: osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, septic shock (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nParaclinical investigations\nRadiography in case of suspected osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.\nTreatment\nTreatment is surgical incision and drainage, under aseptic conditions (i.e. sterile consumables and instruments,\nantiseptic skin preparation).\nRefer to a surgeon any cutaneous abscess:\nlocated in anterior and lateral neck, central triangle of the face, hand, perirectal region, breast, or\nadjacent to major blood vessels (e.g. femoral artery), or\ninvolving joint and bone.\nAntibiotic therapy only if signs of systemic infection, extensive surrounding cellulitis or for individuals with risk\nfactors e.g. immunosuppression or diabetes (for antibiotic therapy, see Erysipelas and cellulitis, Chapter 4).\nEquipment\nSterile scalpel\nSterile curved, non-toothed artery forceps (Kelly type)\nSterile disposable gloves and compresses\nAntiseptic solution and 0.9% sodium chloride\n5 or 10 ml syringe\nAnaesthesia\nFor small (approximately < 5 cm), well delineated abscess in adults: use local anaesthesia with 1% lidocaine\nwithout epinephrine (10 mg/ml): 15 to 20 ml.\nFor larger (approximately > 5 cm), deep or poorly delineated abscess in adults or for abscess in children: consider\nprocedural sedation or general anaesthesia (ketamine IM: 10 mg/kg).\nFor analgesia, see Pain, Chapter 1.\nTechnique\nIncision\n(Figure 8a)\nPage 34 6/ 409\nHold the scalpel between the thumb and middle finger of the dominant hand, the index finger presses on the handle.\nHold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. The scalpel blade should be perpendicular\nto the skin.\nThe incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. The incision must be long enough for a\nfinger to be inserted.\nFigure 8a\nIncision with a scalpel\nDigital exploration\n(Figure 8b)\nExplore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus (and\nforeign body, if present) and explore to the edges of the cavity.\nThe exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to\nunderlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical\nadvice.\nFigure 8b\nExploration of the cavity,\nbreaking down any loculi\nWashing\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with 0.9% sodium chloride.\nDrainage\n(Figure 8c)\nOnly necessary for deep abscesses.\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a\nsingle suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\nPage 34 7/ 409\nFigure 8c\nDrain fixed to the skin\nDressing\nCover with sterile compresses.\nPage 34 8/ 409\nPyomyositis\nPyomyositis is an infection of the muscle, almost always due to Staphylococcus aureus. It most commonly affects the\nmuscles of the limbs and torso. Infections may occur simultaneously in multiple sites.\nRisk factors include immunosuppression, concurrent S. aureus infection, malnutrition, trauma and injection drug use.\nRisk of mortality is significant if treatment is delayed.\nClinical features\nSigns and symptoms:\nlocal: exquisite muscle tenderness, oedema giving muscles \"woody\" texture on palpation.\nsystemic: regional adenopathy and fever.\npyomyositis of the psoas muscle: patient keeps hip flexed and experiences pain on hip extension. If the abscess\nis on the right side, the clinical signs are the same as for appendicitis with pain in the right iliac fossa.\nComplications: septic emboli, endocarditis and septic arthritis, septic shock (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nParaclinical investigations\nPOCUS a : assists in characterisation of abscess; can rule out deep venous thrombosis.\nRadiography: may demonstrate a foreign body, signs of osteomyelitis or osteosarcoma.\nTreatment\nImmobilise the limb.\nSystematic antibiotic therapy (see Erysipelas and cellulitis, Chapter 4).\nAdapt analgesics to the pain level (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nApply compresses soaked in 70% alcohol 2 times daily (max. 3 times daily to prevent burns to the skin) until incision\nand drainage.\nTreatment is surgical incision and drainage, under aseptic conditions (sterile consumables and instruments,\nantiseptic skin preparation) following the rules for incision and drainage of abscesses (see Cutaneous abscess,\nChapter 10). Muscle abscesses are often deeper than other abscesses. As a result, aspiration with a large bore\nneedle may be necessary to locate the abscess. Needle aspiration is insufficient treatment even if pus is evacuated\nand should be followed by surgical incision and drainage.\nIn case of pyomyositis of the psoas muscle, start antibiotics and refer to a surgeon.\nEquipment and anaesthesia\nAs for Cutaneous abscess, Chapter 10.\nTechnique\nGenerous incision along the axis of the limb, over the site of the abscess and avoiding underlying neurovascular\nstuctures; incise the skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscular fascia with a scalpel (Figure 9a).\nDissect the muscle fibres with non-toothed forceps (Kelly type) or round tipped scissors. Insert the instrument or a\nfinger into the muscle until the purulent cavity is reached.

They are common in tropical regions, resulting from varied\naetiologies:\nvascular: venous and/or arterial insufficiency,\nbacterial: leprosy, Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans), phagedenic ulcer, yaws, syphilis,\nparasitic: dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease), leishmaniasis,\nmetabolic: diabetes,\ntraumatic: trauma is often a precipitating factor combined with another underlying cause.\nThe history of the disease and a complete clinical examination (paying particular attention to the neurological\nexamination to determine if there is a peripheral neuropathy caused by leprosy or diabetes) usually leads to an\naetiological diagnosis.\nAll ulcers may become complicated with either local or regional secondary infections (abscess, lymphadenopathy,\nadenitis, osteomyelitis, erysipela, pyodermitis), generalised infection (septicaemia), tetanus and after many years of\nevolution, skin cancer.\nDaily local treatment\nBathe the leg for 10 to 15 minutes in NaDCC and rinse in boiled water.\nRemove any necrotic (black) and fibrinous (yellowish) tissue using compresses or excise the tissue with a scalpel.\nApply:\nto a clean ulcer, with little discharge: 10% povidone iodine and vaseline;\nto a dirty ulcer, with little discharge: silver sulfadiazine to a limited area (monitor for systemic adverse effects);\nto an oozing ulcer: 10% povidone iodine alone;\nto an extensive, oozing ulcer or multiple ulcers: diluted povidone iodine (1/4 of 10% povidone iodine + 3/4 of\n0.9% sodium chloride or clean water) for one minute then rinse with 0.9% sodium chloride or clean water to\nreduce the risk of transcutaneous iodine absorption.\nCover with a dry sterile dressing.\nSystemic treatment\nTreatment with analgesics in the event of pain: adapt the level and dosage to the individual (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nGive systemic antibiotics in case of:\nSecondary infection (see Bacterial skin infections, Chapter 4).\nPhagedenic ulcer (in the early stages, antibiotics may be useful. They are often ineffective in the chronic\nstages):\ndoxycycline PO (except in children under 8 years and pregnant or lactating women)\nChildren 8 years and over: 4 mg/kg once daily\nAdults: 200 mg once daily\nor\nmetronidazole PO\nChildren: 10 mg/kg 3 times daily\nAdults: 500 mg 3 times daily\nIf after 7 days, antibiotherapy is effective, continue with doxycycline or metronidazole as above. Treatment\nduration varies according to the clinical evolution.\nTreat the cause.\nComplementary therapy:\nElevate the legs in cases of venous and/or lymphatic insufficiency.\nPage 35 1/ 409\nTetanus prophylaxis if appropriate (see Tetanus, Chapter 7).\nSkin graft if the ulcer is extensive, clean, red and flat. Skin grafts are often necessary after surgical excision to\nheal phagedenic and Buruli ulcers.\nPage 35 2/ 409\nNecrotising infections of the skin and soft\ntissues\nInvasive infections of the soft tissues: skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial or deep fascia, muscles. They include\nnecrotising cellulitis, necrotising fasciitis, myonecrosis, gas gangrene, etc.\nClinical presentation depends on the causative organism and the stage of progression. Group A streptococcus is\nfrequently isolated, as are Staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae and anaerobic bacteria including Clostridium\nsp.\nDelay in treatment of a minor wound or certain types of wounds (gunshot wounds or stabbings, open fractures or non-\nsterile intramuscular injections/circumcisions) or certain infections (varicella or omphalitis), favours the development of\na necrotising infection. Patient risk factors include immunosuppression, diabetes, malnutrition and advanced age.\nA necrotising infection is a surgical emergency and has a high mortality rate.\nClinical features\nInitial signs and symptoms include erythema, oedema and pain disproportionate to appearance of infection.\nLocation depends on the portal of entry. It may be difficult to differentiate necrotising infections from\nnonnecrotising infections (see Erysipelas and cellulitis, Chapter 4). Systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia\netc.) may be present.\nLesions progress rapidly despite antibiotic therapy, with the development of the typical signs of a necrotizing\ninfection: haemorrhagic blisters and necrosis (cold bluish or blackish hypoaesthetic macules).\nSigns of late infection: crepitus on palpation and fetid odour (gas gangrene) with signs of severe systemic infection\n(see Shock, Chapter 1).\nLaboratory\nIf available, the following tests can help identify an early necrotising infection: white blood cell count > 15 000/mm\u00b3\nor < 4000/mm\u00b3; serum creatinine > 141 micromol/litre; serum glucose > 10 mmol/litre (180 mg/dl) or < 3.3 mmol/litre\n(60 mg/dl). However, normal results do not exclude a necrotising infection.\nObtain specimens for bacterial culture in the operating room and blood cultures if possible.\nParaclinical investigations\nRadiography: may demonstrate gas in muscles or along the fascia planes. Can rule out foreign body, osteomyelitis or\nosteosarcoma.\nTreatment\nPrompt surgical management accompanied by IV antibiotic therapy is essential to reduce the high mortality. Refer\nimmediately to a surgeon. Start resuscitation if necessary (see Shock, Chapter 1).\nEmergency surgical treatment:\nDebridement, drainage, wide excision of necrotic tissue and rapid amputation if necessary.\nSurgical re-evaluation within 24 to 36 hours to check for eventual progression of the necrosis and need for\nfurther debridement.\nPage 35 3/ 409\nIV antibiotic therapy for at least 14 days or more depending on clinical response:\ncloxacillin + ceftriaxone + clindamycin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + clindamycin.

Do not dilute in glucose.\nPage 35 4/ 409\nVenomous bites and stings\nSnake bites and envenomation\nMore than 50% of the bites are dry bites, i.e. no envenomation occurred. In the event that venom is injected, the\nseverity of envenomation depends on the species, the amount of venom injected, the location of the bite (bites on\nthe head and neck are the most dangerous) and the weight, general condition and age of the individual (more serious\nin children).\nIt is rare that the snake involved is identified. However, observation of the clinical signs may orient diagnosis and\nmanagement. Two major syndromes are identified:\nneurological disorders that evolve towards respiratory muscle paralysis and coma are common manifestations\nof elapid envenomation (cobra, mamba, etc.);\nextensive local lesions (intense pain, inflammation with oedema and necrosis) and coagulation abnormalities are\ncommon manifestations of viperid or crotalid (rattle snake) envenomation.\nClinical manifestations and management of bites and envenomations are described in the table below.\nEarly diagnosis and monitoring of coagulation abnormalities is based on whole blood clotting tests performed in a\ndry tube (at the patient\u2019s arrival and then every 4 to 6 hours for the first day).\nTake 2 to 5 ml of whole blood, wait 30 minutes and examine the tube:\nComplete clotting: no coagulation abnormality\nIncomplete clotting or no clotting: coagulation abnormality, susceptibility to bleeding a\nIn the event of coagulation abnormalities, continue to monitor once daily until coagulation returns to normal.\nAetiological treatment is based on the administration of snake antivenom serum, only if there are clear clinical\nmanifestations of envenomation or coagulation abnormalities are observed.\nAntivenom sera are effective, but rarely available (verify local availability) and difficult to store. Antivenom serum\nshould be administered as early as possible: by IV infusion (in 0.9% sodium chloride) if using a poorly purified serum;\nby slow IV in the event of severe envenomation if the serum is known to be well purified. Repeat antivenom serum\nadministration after 4 or 6 hours if the symptoms of envenomation persist.\nFor all patients, be prepared for an anaphylactic reaction, which, despite its potential severity (shock), is\nusually more easily controlled than coagulation disorders or serious neurological disorders.\nIn asymptomatic patients (bites without signs of envenomation and with normal coagulation), monitoring must\ncontinue for at least 12 hours (24 hours preferred).\nClinical signs and treatment\nPage 35 5/ 409\nTime\nPossible\nsince Clinical manifestations Treatment\naggressor\nbite\nBite\n0 Fang marks ?

Management includes strict rest,\nwound cleansing, analgesics PO, and tetanus prophylaxis (see Tetanus, Chapter 7).\nIn patients with significant pain, infiltrate the area around the sting with local anaesthetic (1% lidocaine). Observe\nfor 12 hours.\nGeneral signs appear in the event of severe envenomation: hypertension, excessive salivation and sweating,\nhyperthermia, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pain, respiratory difficulties, seizures; rarely, shock.\nAetiological treatment:\nThe use of scorpion antivenom sera is controversial (most of them are not very effective; they may be poorly\ntolerated due to insufficient purification).\nIn practice, in countries where scorpion envenomations are severe (North Africa, the Middle East, Central America\nand Amazonia), check local availability of antivenom sera and follow national recommendations.\nThe criteria for administration are the severity of the envenomation, the age of the patient (more severe in children)\nand the time elapsed since the sting. This should not exceed 2 to 3 hours. If the time elapsed is more than 2 or 3\nhours, the benefit of antivenom serum is poor in comparison with the risk of anaphylaxis (in contrast to\nenvenomation by snakes).\nSymptomatic treatment:\nIn the event of vomiting, diarrhoea or excessive sweating: prevention of dehydration (oral rehydration salts),\nespecially in children.\nIn the event of muscle pain: 10% calcium gluconate slow IV (children: 5 ml per injection, adults: 10 ml per\ninjection, administered over 10 to 20 minutes).\nIn the event of seizures: diazepam may be used with caution; the risk of respiratory depression is increased in\nenvenomated patients (see Seizures, Chapter 1).\nSpider bites and envenomation\nTreatment is usually limited to wound cleansing, strict rest, analgesics PO and tetanus prophylaxis (see Tetanus,\nChapter 7).\nSevere envenomations are rare. There are two main clinical syndromes:\nNeurotoxic syndrome (black widow spider): severe muscle pain, tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, vomiting,\nheadache, excessive sweating. The signs develop for 24 hours and then resolve spontaneously over a few\ndays.\nNecrotic syndrome (recluse spider): local tissue lesions, possible necrosis and ulceration; mild general signs\n(fever, chills, malaise and vomiting) which usually resolve over a few days. If present, haemolysis may sometimes\nbe life threatening.\nAs well as the general measures listed above, treatment includes administration of 10% calcium gluconate by slow IV\nin the event of muscle spasms (children: 5 ml per injection, adults: 10 ml per injection, administered over 10 to 20\nminutes).\nIncision and debridement of necrotic tissue are not recommended (not useful; may impair healing).\nHymenoptera stings (honeybees, wasps and hornets)\nPage 35 7/ 409\nLocal care: remove the embedded sting (bee); clean with soap and water; calamine lotion if pruriginous (children and\nadults: one application 3 to 4 times daily in a thin layer).\nAnalgesics if necessary (paracetamol PO).\nIn the event of an anaphylactic reaction:\nepinephrine (adrenaline) IM\nUse undiluted epinephrine solution (1:1000 = 1 mg/ml) and a 1 ml syringe graduated in 0.01 ml in children:\nChildren under 6 years: 0.15 ml\nChildren from 6 to 12 years: 0.3 ml\nChildren over 12 years and adults: 0.5 ml\nFor children, if 1 ml syringe is not available, use a diluted solution, i.e. add 1 mg epinephine to 9 ml of 0.9% sodium\nchloride to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml solution (1:10 000):\nChildren under 6 years: 1.5 ml\nChildren from 6 to 12 years: 3 ml\nRepeat after 5 minutes if no clinical improvement.\nIn patients with circulatory collapse or those who deteriorate despite receiving IM epinephrine, use IV epinephrine\n(for doses, see Anaphylactic shock, Chapter 1).\nFootnotes\n(a) There can be a considerable delay between the decrease in coagulation factors (less than 30 minutes after the bite) and\nthe first signs of bleeding (other than bleeding at the site of the bite and/or the development of sero-sanguinous blisters),\nwhich may appear only 3 days after the bite. Conversely, bleeding may resolve prior to normalization of coagulation\nparameters.\nPage 35 8/ 409\nDental infections\nInfection arising as a secondary complication of an inflammation of the dental pulp. The severity and the treatment of\ndental infections depend on their evolution: localised to the infected tooth, extended to adjacent anatomical\nstructures or diffuse infections.\nClinical features and treatment\nInfection localised to a tooth and its surroundings (acute dental abscess)\nIntense and continuous pain.\nOn examination: swelling limited to the gum surrounding the infected tooth. Purulent exudate may be present\ndraining either through the root canal, or through the periodontal ligament (loosening the tooth) or through a gingival\nfistula. There are no signs of the infection extending to adjacent anatomical structures nor general signs of\ninfection.\nTreatment:\nTreatment is only surgical (the source of infection is inaccessible to antibiotics): root canal therapy (disinfection\nof the root canal) if possible or extraction of the tooth.\nPain: paracetamol or ibuprofen PO (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nInfections extending to adjacent anatomical structures (acute dento-alveolar abscess)\nLocal spreading of an acute dental abscess into the surrounding bone and tissue.\nPainful gingival and buccal swelling with warm and tender skin, developing into a ripe abscess: intense pain, with\ntrismus, particularly if the infection is in a posterior tooth, presence of general signs (fever, fatigue, cervical\nlymphadenopathy).\nIn patients with acute gangrenous cellulitis (crepitations on palpation), treat as an infection extending into the\ncervico-facial tissues (see below).\nTreatment:\nFirst surgical: incision and drainage of the pus or extraction of the tooth.\nThen antibiotic treatment for 5 days following the procedure:\namoxicillin PO\nChildren: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily\nAdults: 1 g 2 times daily\nNotes:\nIf the dental procedure has to be delayed (local anaesthesia not possible due to inflammation, significant\ntrismus), start an antibiotherapy, but the dental procedure must be completed in the following days.\nIf there is no improvement within 48 to 72 hours after the dental procedure, do not change antibiotic, but start a\nnew procedure on the tooth.\nPain: paracetamol or ibuprofen PO (see Pain, Chapter 1).\nInfections extending into the cervico-facial tissues\nExtremely serious cellulitis, with rapidly spreading cervical or facial tissue necrosis and signs of septicaemia.\nTreatment:\ntreatment in an intensive care unit.\nhigh dose antibiotic treatment (see Necrotising infections of the skin and soft tissues).\nextraction of the tooth.\nPage 35 9/ 409\nChapter 11: Mental disorders in adults\nAnxiety\nInsomnia\nAgitation\nAcute confusional state (delirium)\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nDepression\nPsychotic disorders\nAcute psychotic episode\nChronic psychoses\nBipolar disorder\nPage 36 0/ 409\nAnxiety\nLast updated: November 2021\nA patient suffering from anxiety has:\npsychological symptoms: pervasive worries, e.g. fear of having a serious illness, fear with no clearly-defined object\nor phobias;\nbehavioural changes: nervousness, avoidance behaviour, self-isolating tendency, irritability;\nphysical symptoms: e.g. dry mouth, \u201clump in the throat\u201d; sometimes medically unexplained symptoms (e.g. feeling of\nmalaise, hot flashes or chills, diffuse pain);\nconcentration difficulties, sleep problems (difficulty getting to sleep, recurrent nightmares).\nAnxiety is a common feature in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis. It can also occur in isolation,\nnot associated with any other mental disorders. Anxiety symptoms often occur immediately after a difficult life event.\nMedically unexplained symptoms are frequent in refugees and people exposed to adversity; in certain cultures they may\nbe the only expression of psychological distress.\nManagement\nTry to determine the source of the anxiety and reassure the patient (without minimising the distress or symptoms). If\nnecessary, use simple relaxation techniques to alleviate the symptoms a .\nIf symptoms are exacerbated (e.g., tachycardia, feeling of suffocation, fear of dying or \u201cgoing crazy,\u201d agitation, or\nconversely, prostration), it may be necessary to administer diazepam: 5 to 10 mg PO or 10 mg IM, to be repeated\nafter one hour if required.\nAcute severe anxiety may justify a short course (max. 2 or 3 weeks) of:\ndiazepam PO: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily; reducing the dose by half in the last few days of treatment\nModerate anxiety lasting more than 2 weeks, administer as first-line treatment:\nhydroxyzine PO: 25 to 50 mg 2 times daily (max. 100 mg daily)\nor, only if there is no improvement after 1 week, diazepam PO: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily for max. 2 weeks.\nIf symptoms recur after treatment discontinuation, do not resume diazepam or hydroxyzine. Re-evaluate for possible\ndepression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nFor generalised anxiety that lasts more than 2 months, and does not improve with psychosocial interventions, an\nantidepressant should be prescribed (fluoxetine or paroxetine PO: 20 mg once daily), to be continued for 2 to 3\nmonths after symptoms resolve then, stop gradually over 2 weeks.\nFootnotes\n(a) For example, in case of hyperventilation, use a technique that controls the respiratory rate: get the patient in a comfortable\nposition with his eyes closed. Help him focus on his breathing so that it becomes calmer and more regular, with three-phase\nbreathing cycles: inhalation (count to three), exhalation (count to three), pause (count to three), etc.\nPage 36 1/ 409\nInsomnia\nLast updated: November 2021\nComplaints may be: difficulty falling or remaining asleep, waking up too early in the morning, nightmares, or fatigue.\nSymptoms occur at least three times a week for at least one month.\nManagement\nIf insomnia is related to an organic cause, treat the cause (e.g. administer analgesics for pain).\na\nIf insomnia is related to the use of alcohol, drugs or a medication , management depends on the substance involved.\nIf insomnia is related to a particular life event (e.g. bereavement), a short term treatment with a sedative may be useful:\npromethazine PO: 25 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 to 10 days\nor, if promethazine is not available, hydroxyzine PO: 25 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 to 10 days\nor, as a last resort (risk of addiction), diazepam PO: 2 to 5 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 days max.\nIf insomnia persists, re-evaluate the patient. Insomnia is a common feature in depression (Depression), post-traumatic\nstress disorder (Post-traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety disorders (Anxiety). In such cases, the underlying disorder\nshould be addressed.\nFootnotes\n(a) The main drugs known to cause sleep problems are corticosteroids, beta blockers, levodopa/carbidopa, fluoxetine,\nlevothyroxine, etc.\nPage 36 2/ 409\nAgitation\nLast updated: November 2021\nPeople who have recently experienced violent events, or with anxiety, depression, psychotic disorders or delirium, may\nhave periods of psychomotor agitation.\nAgitation is common in acute intoxication (alcohol/psychostimulant drugs) and withdrawal syndrome. Certain drugs may\ncause agitation (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), levodopa, mefloquine, efavirenz, etc.).\nAgitation may be accompanied by oppositional, violent or fleeing behaviour.\nManagement\nClinical evaluation is best performed in pairs, in a calm setting, with or without the person\u2019s family/friends, depending on\nthe situation.\nIt is essential to check for signs of delirium. If present, the priority is to identify the cause and treat it (see Acute\nconfusional state).\nIt may be necessary to administer diazepam 10 mg PO to reduce the agitation and conduct the clinical exam, without\nover-sedating the patient.\nIf the patient is violent or dangerous, urgent sedation is required: diazepam IM 10 mg, to be repeated after 30 to 60\nminutes if necessary.\nPhysical restraint should only be used in certain circumstances, strictly following the procedure in place.\nAvoid diazepam if agitation is related to acute alcohol intoxication or in case of delirium (risk of respiratory depression).\nUse haloperidol (see Acute confusional state).\nAlcoholic patients can experience withdrawal symptoms within 6 to 24 hours after they stop drinking. Withdrawal\nsyndrome should be taken into consideration in patients who are hospitalised and therefore forced to stop drinking\nabruptly. In the early phase (pre-delirium tremens), the symptoms include irritability, a general feeling of malaise, profuse\nsweating and shaking. Treatment consists in:\ndiazepam PO (10 mg every 6 hours for 1 to 3 days, then reduce and stop over 7 days)\n+ oral hydration (3 litres of water daily)\n+ thiamine IM or very slow IV (100 mg 3 times daily for at least 3 days)\nIf the agitation is associated with anxiety, see Anxiety; if associated with psychotic disorders, see Psychotic disorders.\nPage 36 3/ 409\nAcute confusional state (delirium)\nLast updated: July 2022\nClinical features\nThe clinical picture includes:\ndisorientation in time and space;\nimpaired consciousness;\nconcentration problems;\nmemory impairment.\nThese symptoms develop rapidly (hours or days), and often fluctuate during the course of the day.\nAgitation, delusions, behavioural disorders and hallucinations (often visual) may be associated symptoms.\nManagement\nDelirium almost always has an organic cause:\nInfectious: meningitis, severe malaria, encephalitis, septicaemia, syphilis, AIDS, etc.\nMetabolic: hyper/hypoglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance, niacin (vitamin PP or B ) or thiamine (vitamin B )\n3 1\ndeficiencies, etc.\nEndocrine: thyroid disorders\nNeurological: epilepsy, raised intracranial pressure, head trauma, meningeal haemorrhage, brain tumour, etc.\nAlso consider the use of drugs which may cause delirium (opioid analgesics, psychotropic drugs, fluoroquinolones, etc.),\nuse of toxic substances (alcohol/drugs), or withdrawal from these substances.\nDelirium requires hospitalisation.\nTreat the underlying cause.\nProvide supportive care (i.e. nutrition, fluid, electrolyte balance); ensure bladder function.\nEnsure that the patient receives only medications appropriate to their needs.\nTreat pain if needed (see Pain, Chapter 1);\nEnsure adequate sensory environment: low lightening, limit noise.\nThe administration of diazepam may increase delirium. If it is absolutely necessary to sedate an agitated patient, use\nlow dose haloperidol for a short time (7 days or less):\nhaloperidol PO: 0.5 to 1 mg 2 times daily\nor haloperidol IM: 0.5 to 1 mg, to be repeated if the patient is still agitated 30 to 60 minutes after the first injection.\nIf necessary, administer additional doses every 4 hours, do not exceed a total dose of 5 mg daily.\nIn case of delirium related to alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens):\nAdmit the patient to an intensive care unit.\nAdminister diazepam IV: 10 to 20 mg 4 to 6 times daily, under close supervision with ventilation equipment near at\nhand.\nThe goal is to achieve mild sedation without provoking respiratory depression. The doses and duration of the\ntreatment are adjusted according to the clinical progress.\nIV hydration: 2 to 4 litres 0.9% sodium chloride per 24 hours.\nAdminister thiamine IM or very slow IV (over 30 minutes): 100 mg 3 times daily for 3 to 5 days.\nMonitor vital signs and blood glucose levels.\nPage 36 4/ 409\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nLast updated: November 2021\nAn event is \u201ctraumatic\u201d when someone has been directly confronted with death, either by seeing another person being\nkilled or seriously injured as the result of violence, or by experiencing serious harm, such as a threat to his/her life or\nphysical integrity (e.g. rape, torture). Exposure to one or several of these events causes feelings of helplessness and\nhorror.\nImmediate, transitory symptoms (disorientation, anxiety, sadness, fleeing, etc.) are to be distinguished from secondary,\nlong-lasting problems that appear and/or last several weeks or months after the event: post-traumatic stress, often\nassociated with depression (Depression), or sometimes acute psychosis (Psychotic disorders), even in people with no\nhistory of psychotic symptoms.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by three types of psychological response, generally seen in\ncombination [1] .\nPersistent re-experiencing\nThe patient describes:\nimages, thoughts or perceptions related to the traumatic experience, which intrude despite efforts to block\nthem out, including at night in the form of distressing dreams;\nflashbacks during which the patient \u201crelives\u201d parts of the traumatic scene.\nAvoidance\nThe patient tries to avoid:\nplaces, situations and people that might be associated with the trauma;\nhaving thoughts or feelings related to the trauma; patients may use alcohol, drugs or any psychotropic agents\nfor this purpose.\nPersistent perceptions of heightened current threat\nHypervigilance (constant state of alert), exaggerated startle reaction, anxiety, insomnia, poor\nconcentration; sometimes somatic symptoms (sweating, shaking, tachycardia, headache, etc.).\nRe-experiencing is highly distressing and causes disorders that may worsen over time; people isolate themselves,\nbehave differently, stop fulfilling their family/social obligations, and experience diffuse pain and mental exhaustion.\nManagement\nPsychological intervention is essential to reduce the suffering, disabling symptoms and social handicaps resulting from\nPTSD.\nIt is important to reassure the patient that their symptoms are a normal response to an abnormal event. Sessions\nshould be conducted with tact. The patient should be listened to. Avoid intensely questioning the patient about their\nemotions: leave it to the patient to decide how far they want to go.\nAssociated symptoms (anxiety or insomnia), if persistent, can be relieved by symptomatic treatment (see Anxiety and\nInsomnia) for no more than two weeks.\nIf the patient has severe symptoms (obsessive thoughts, pronounced hypervigilance, comorbid despression etc.), the\npharmacological treatment is fluoxetine PO (20 mg once daily) or paroxetine PO (10 to 20 mg once daily) or sertraline\nPO (50 mg once daily), to be continued for 2 to 3 months after symptoms resolve then, stop gradually.\nPage 36 5/ 409\nReferences\n1.

For example, the depressed patient may\nexpress multiple somatic complaints rather than psychological distress. Depression may also manifest itself as an\nacute psychotic disorder in a given cultural context.\nManagement\nWhen faced with symptoms of depression, consider an underlying organic cause (e.g. hypothyroidism or Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease) or adverse effects from medical treatment (corticosteroids, cycloserine, efavirenz, mefloquine, etc.). Look for\na triggering event (e.g. sexual violence, recent childbirth and post-partum depression).\nDepressive disorders are the most common mental disorders in patients with severe chronic infectious diseases such\nas HIV infection or tuberculosis. These disorders should not be neglected, especially as they have a negative impact on\nadherence to treatment.\nSymptoms of depression are common after a major loss (bereavement, forced displacement, etc.). They gradually\nsubside, in most cases, with social support. Psychological support may be useful.\nPharmacological treatment should always be offered, along with counseling, to patients with severe depression\n(Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score > 19; severe functional impairment, psychotic symptoms, and/or\nsuicidal risk).\nIn patients with moderately severe depression (PHQ-9 score 15-19), pharmacological treatment should be considered\nif there is no improvement after 3 counselling sessions, or from the outset if patients express a personal preference for\nit.\nBefore prescribing, make sure that 9-month treatment and follow-up (psychological support, adherence and response)\nare possible.\nPage 36 7/ 409\nPreferably use a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), particularly in older patients. Preferably use fluoxetine, except during\npregnancy when sertraline is preferred.\nfluoxetine PO: 20 mg on alternate days for one week, then once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary\n(max. 40 mg daily); use with caution in patients with severe anxiety disorders or who are immobilised (e.g. wounded)\nor\nparoxetine PO: 10 mg once daily for 3 days, then 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary\n(max. 40 mg daily), especially if the depression is accompanied by severe anxiety\nor\nsertraline PO: 25 mg once daily for 3 days, then 50 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary\n(max. 100 mg daily)\nAssess tolerance and response every week for 4 weeks. If the response is inadequate after 4 weeks at optimal dose\nor if the SRI is poorly tolerated, replace with another SRI (there is no need for a medication-free interval between the\ntwo).\nIf SRIs are not available, amitriptyline PO may be used as an alternative: start with 25 mg once daily at bedtime and\ngradually increase over 8 to 10 days to 75 mg once daily (max. 150 mg daily). The therapeutic dose is close to the\nlethal dose; in older patients, reduce the dose by half.\nThere is a delay of 2 to 3 weeks before the antidepressant effect of SRIs occurs, at least 4 weeks for amitriptyline.\nDuring this period, anxiety may be exacerbated and the risk of suicide may increase, especially with\nfluoxetine. Hydroxyzine PO (25 to 50 mg 2 times daily, max 100 mg daily) or promethazine PO (25 to 50 mg once daily\nat bedtime) may be given for the first 2 weeks of treatment. If there is no improvement after 1 week, change to\ndiazepam PO (2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily) for 2 weeks max.\nDuring the first 2 to 4 weeks, do not give the patient more tablets than the quantity required for each week or entrust\nthe treatment to someone in the patient's close entourage that can initially ensure administration of the drug.\nSevere depression carries the risk of suicide. Talking to patients about this will not increase the risk of suicide attempt.\nOn the contrary \u2013 depressed people are often anxious and ambivalent about suicide and feel relieved when able to talk\nabout it.\nIf major symptoms have not improved after a month of treatment, increase to the maximum dose and assess after 2\nweeks. If there is no improvement, refer the patient to a psychiatrist, if possible; if not, try a different antidepressant.\nThe treatment should always be stopped gradually over a 4-week period. Inform the patient about problems\nassociated with abrupt treatment discontinuation (very common with paroxetine).\nSpecial situations: pregnant or breast-feeding women\nPregnancy in a woman under antidepressants:\nRe-evaluate the need to continue treatment. If treatment is still necessary, it is best to continue a treatment that\nhas been effective rather than switching to a different antidepressant. Nevertheless, if the woman plans to\nbreastfeed and is taking fluoxetine, consider switching to another SRI at least 3 weeks before expected delivery to\nreduce adverse effects in the neonate during breastfeeding. Monitor the neonate the first few days of life for signs\nof toxicity or withdrawal symptoms.\nDepression occurring during pregnancy or during post-partum period:\nDepression is more frequent in the post-partum (breast-feeding) period than in pregnancy. In case of severe post-\npartum depression in a breast-feeding woman: use sertraline as first-line option, or if not available, use paroxetine:\ndo not administer fluoxetine. In case of severe depression during pregnancy: use sertraline, avoid paroxetine.\nFootnotes\nPage 36 8/ 409\n(a) Hence the importance of working with an \u201cinformant\u201d (in the anthropological sense of the word) when dealing with\nunfamiliar cultural contexts.\nPage 36 9/ 409\nPsychotic disorders\nAcute psychotic episode\nChronic psychoses\nBipolar disorder\nLast updated: July 2022\nPsychoses are characterised by delusions (the patient is convinced of things that are not real and not accounted for by\nthe person\u2019s cultural background), or hallucinations (the patient hears voices that do not exist) and behavioural\nsymptoms (e.g. strange behaviour, agitation, mutism, opposition, fleeing).\nManagement includes psychosocial support and antipsychotic medication.\nTreatment efficacy and prognosis depend largely on the quality of the therapeutic relationship established with the\npatient and their family.\nKeeping the patient at home with outpatient follow-up is preferred if there is no risk of self-harm or harm to others, and\nif the family is capable of managing the disorder.\nInterpretation of psychotic symptoms vary according to the cultural context a . For example, psychotic disorders may\nbe attributed to charms or to ancestor intervention. Therapeutic approach should take those beliefs into account.\nPatients are usually already under \u201ctraditional\u201d treatments, this should not be seen as an obstacle to conventional\nmedical treatment.\nFootnotes\n(a) Hence the importance of working with an \u201cinformant\u201d (in the anthropological sense of the word) when dealing with\nunfamiliar cultural contexts.\nPage 37 0/ 409\nAcute psychotic episode\nLast updated: July 2022\nAn acute psychotic episode can be a one-time occurrence, usually of sudden onset, or can occur repeatedly, or it may\nbe the early phase of chronic psychosis. It can occur following an adverse life event (e.g. loss, acute stress or trauma).\nIn postpartum psychosis, delusions are frequently related to the mother-child relationship.\nBefore prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see Acute\nconfusional state (delirium)) or substance use; check and record blood pressure, heart rate, weight.\nAntipsychotic treatment is the same as for chronic psychoses (haloperidol or risperidone) and should last at least 3\nmonths. After 3 months, if the patient is stable, stop the treatment gradually over 4 weeks, monitoring for potential\nrelapse. If the acute episode lasted more than 3 months, continue antipsychotic treatment for at least 2 years.\nFor severe anxiety or agitation, a short-course anxiolytic or sedative treatment may be added to the antipsychotic\ntreatment, at the beginning of treatment.\nPage 37 1/ 409\nChronic psychoses\nLast updated: July 2022\nChronic psychoses (schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, etc.) are defined by specific clinical characteristics and their\nlong-term nature.\nSchizophrenia is characterized by delusions, disorganized thinking, hallucinations, depersonalisation, loss of motivation,\ndiminished emotional expression, impaired cognition, abnormal behaviour and neglected hygiene. Such patients are\noften very anxious.\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and improve social and occupational functioning. It offers real benefits,\neven if chronic symptoms persist (tendency toward social isolation, possible relapses and periods of increased\nbehavioural problems, etc.).\nBefore prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see Acute\nconfusional state (delirium)) and use of substances. Check and record blood pressure, heart rate and weight.\nTreatment should last at least one year, possibly for life, particularly in patients with schizophrenia. Uncertainty about\nthe possibility of follow-up at one year or beyond is no reason not to treat. However, it is better not to start\npharmacological treatment for patients who have no family/social support (e.g. homeless), provided they do not have\nsevere behavioural disorders.\nOnly prescribe one antipsychotic at a time. To limit the risk of adverse effects, start treatment at a low dose and\ngradually increase until the minimum effective dose is reached. In older patients, reduce the dose by half, whichever\nmedication is used.\nHaloperidol is the first-line antipsychotic. Preferably use oral haloperidol with a view to switching to long-acting\nhaloperidol (haloperidol decanoate) if the patient is likely to need long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia).\nhaloperidol PO: start with 0.5 mg 2 times daily for 3 days then 1 mg 2 times daily until the end of the first week;\nincrease to 2.5 mg 2 times daily the second week. After 2 weeks, assess if the treatment is well tolerated and\neffective. If it is not effective, check adherence; if necessary increase to 5 mg 2 times daily (max. 15 mg daily).\nIf haloperidol is not available, contraindicated or poorly tolerated, possible alternative are:\nrisperidone PO: 1 mg 2 times daily for one week, then 2 mg 2 times daily for one week; if necessary, increase to 3 mg\n2 times daily as of the third week (max. 10 mg daily).\nor\nchlorpromazine PO (especially if a sedative effect is required):\n25 to 50 mg once daily in the evening for one week; if necessary, increase to 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the\nevening for one week; if necessary, 100 mg 3 times daily as of the third week.\nor\nolanzapine PO: 10 mg once daily; if necessary, increase by 5 mg every week (max. 20 mg daily).\nIn case of extrapyramidal symptoms, try reducing the dose of antipsychotic or, if the extrapyramidal symptoms are\nsevere, add biperiden PO: 2 mg once daily, increase if necessary up to 2 mg 2 to 3 times daily (if biperiden is not\navailable, use trihexyphenidyl PO at the same dosage).\nFor severe anxiety, it is possible to add a short-course anxiolytic treatment (for a few days to max. 2 to 3 weeks) to\nthe antipsychotic treatment:\ndiazepam PO: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily\nFor major agitation:\nPage 37 2/ 409\nIf the patient is not under antipsychotic treatment:\nhaloperidol PO 5 mg + promethazine PO 25 mg, to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary. After a further 60\nminutes, if necessary administer promethazine IM 50 mg.\nIn case of hostile or agressive behaviour, use IM route (same dose), to be repeated after 30 minutes if necessary;\nafter a further 30 minutes, if necessary, administer promethazine IM 50 mg.\nHigh doses of haloperidol can induce extrapyramidal symptoms, add biperiden if necessary.\nIf the patient is already under antipsychotic treatment:\ndiazepam PO or IM: 10 mg to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary\nDo not combine two antipsychotics.\nFor long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia) a long-acting antipsychotic drug can be used once the\npatient has been stabilised on oral treatment. The dosage depends on the oral dose the patient is taking. The switch\nfrom oral to a long-acting antipsychotic should be gradual, according to a specific protocol. For information, at the\nend of the transition period from oral to long-acting antipsychotic, the dose of haloperidol decanoate IM administered\nevery 3 to 4 weeks is approximately:\nDaily dose Monthly dose of\nof haloperidol PO haloperidol decanoate IM (a)\n2.5 mg 25 mg\n5 mg 50 mg\n10 mg 100 mg\n15 mg 150 mg\n(a) If haloperidol decanoate is not available, fluphenazine IM: 12.5 to 50 mg/injection every 3 to 4 weeks.\nFor a patient on risperidone PO: gradually decrease the dose of risperidone by slowly introducing haloperidol PO then,\nonce the patient is stabilised, change to haloperidol decanoate every 3 to 4 weeks as above.\nSpecial situations: pregnant or breast-feeding women\nIn the event of pregnancy in a woman taking antipsychotics: re-evaluate the need to continue the treatment. If\ntreatment is still necessary, administer the minimal effective dose and avoid combination with an anticholinergic\n(biperiden or trihexphenidyl). Monitor the neonate for extrapyramidal symptoms during the first few days of life.\nFirst symptoms of psychosis during pregnancy: start with the lowest dose of haloperidol and only increase slowly if\nnecessary.\nPost-partum psychosis: if the woman is breast-feeding, haloperidol should be preferred.\nLong-acting antipsychotics should not be administered.\nPage 37 3/ 409\nBipolar disorder\nLast updated: July 2022\nBipolar disorder is characterised by alternating manic and depressive episodes a , generally separated by \u201cnormal\u201d\nperiods lasting several months or years.\nEpisodes of mania are characterised by elation, euphoria and hyperactivity accompanied by insomnia, grandiose ideas,\nand loss of social inhibitions (sexual, in particular).\nDepressive episodes are often severe, with significant risk of suicide.\nLook for family history of similar symptoms (particularly suicide), very frequent in bipolar patients.\nPharmacological treatment:\nEpisodes of mania are treated with haloperidol PO: 5 mg once daily for 3 days, then 7.5 mg for one week; if\nnecessary, increase by increments of 2.5 mg per week (max. 15 mg daily).\nPossible alternatives:\nrisperidone PO: 2 mg once daily; if necessary, increase in increments of 1 mg per week (max. 6 mg daily).\nor\nolanzapine PO: 10 mg once daily for 3 days; if necessary, increase in increments of 5 mg per week (max. 20 mg\ndaily).\nIf there is improvement after one week of treatment, continue with the same dose for at least 8 weeks after\nremission of symptoms.\nDiazepam PO (5 to 10 mg daily) can be added during the first 2 to 3 weeks.\nIf symptoms do not resolve after 2 weeks of antipsychotic treatment at maximum tolerated dose (and 2 different\nantipsychotics have been tried), add a mood stabiliser:\nvalproic acid PO: 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 1) then 400 mg 2 times daily (Week 2) then 500 mg 2 times daily\n(Week 3). This is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 500 mg weekly\n(max. 1000 mg 2 times daily).\nor\ncarbamazepine PO: 100 mg 2 times daily (Week 1) then 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 2) then 200 mg 3 times daily\n(Week 3). This is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 200 mg\nweekly (max. 1200 mg daily).\nTreatment should be continued until at least 8 weeks after complete remission of symptoms. Assess together with\nthe patient the benefits and risks of pursuing long-term treatment.\nIf is it decided to discontinue antipsychotic treatment, medication should be stopped gradually, monitoring for\npossible relapse.\nDepressive episodes are treated as for depression (see Depression).\nIf the patient has an episode of mania while on antidepressants, immediately stop antidepressants and treat the\nepisode of mania as above. An episode of mania while on antidepressants is indicative of bipolar disorder.\nLong-term treatment for bipolar disorder is based on continuation of the treatment that led to the remission of the\nmanic episode: antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, or a combination of both.\nTreatment can be initiated by a physician trained in mental health, but a consultation should be set up as soon as\npossible with a specialist.\nPage 37 4/ 409\nValproic acid is not recommended in women of childbearing age. If it is necessary to start treatment, use\ncarbamazepine.\nIf a woman of childbearing age is already taking valproic acid, switch to carbamazepine by gradually decreasing the\ndose of valproic acid over a period of 2 weeks (do not stop treatment abruptly) while gradually starting carbamazepine.\nIf a woman becomes pregnant or is planning pregnancy it is essential to contact a specialist to re-evaluate whether the\ntreatment is still necessary and adjust the dose if needed.\nFootnotes\n(a) \u201cUnipolar forms\u201d are characterized by recurring episodes of depression.\nPage 37 5/ 409\nChapter 12: Other conditions\nSickle cell disease\nEpilepsy\nDiabetes type 2 in adults\nEssential hypertension in adults\nHeart failure in adults\nChronic heart failure\nAcute heart failure (acute pulmonary oedema)\nEndemic goitre and iodine deficiency\nPage 37 6/ 409\nSickle cell disease\nHomozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder of haemoglobin (Hb). The abnormal Hb\n(HbS) results in the distortion of red blood cells into a sickle shape leading to increased destruction (haemolysis), an\nincrease in blood viscosity and obstruction of capillaries (vaso-occlusion).\nSCD is common in sub-Saharan Africa (1 to 3% of births), on the American continent, in India and in the Mediterranean\nbasin.\nClinical features\nSymptoms generally begin after 6 months of age.\nMajor signs: recurrent painful crises, chronic anaemia, splenomegaly and frequently, growth retardation and\nmalnutrition in children.\nSerious acute life threatening complications such as stroke, overwhelming infections and acute chest syndrome.\nIn populations in whom the disease is frequent, diagnosis is suggested by a family history of similar clinical signs.\nMajor acute manifestations\nPainful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC)\nChildren under 2 years present with the hand-foot syndrome or dactylitis (acute pain and swelling in the hands or\nfeet).\nChildren older than 2 years and adults present with acute pain affecting the back, chest, abdomen (can resemble an\nacute abdomen) and extremities.\nYoung children may have non-specific signs of a VOC: refusal to walk, irritability, lack of appetite, crying, whimpering\nor moaning when touched, etc.\nLook for an associated infection that might have precipitated the VOC.\nIn case of bony pain in a single location, unresponsive to analgesics (or a persistent limp in a child) associated with\nfever and erythema or swelling, consider an osteomyelitis.\nFever\nLook for infection: in particular pneumonia, cellulitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis and sepsis (patients are particularly\nsusceptible to infections especially due to pneumococcus, meningococcus and Haemophilus influenzae); malaria.\nAcute severe anaemia\nThe chronic anaemia is often complicated by acute severe anaemia with gradually appearing fatigue, pallor of the\nconjunctivae and palms, shortness of breath, tachycardia, syncope or heart failure.\nThe acute anaemia can be due to:\nAcute severe haemolysis often secondary to malaria: fever, haemoglobinuria (dark urine) and yellow\nconjunctivae.\nSplenic sequestration (trapping of blood cells in the spleen), mostly in children 1 to 4 years: sudden enlargement\nof the spleen, severe left upper quadrant pain, thrombocytopenia. Can lead to shock.\nAplastic crisis (transient suspension of red blood cell production by the bone marrow): impalpable spleen and\nabsence of reticulocytes.\nStroke\nPage 37 7/ 409\nMost often ischaemic (due to vaso-occlusion in cerebral vessels) but a stroke can also be haemorrhagic.\nSudden loss of motor function or aphasia, in children and in adults.\nSigns can resemble meningitis and cerebral malaria: headache, photophobia, vomiting, stiff neck, alteration of\nconsciousness and neurologic signs or rarely seizures.\nAcute chest syndrome (ACS)\nChest pain, tachypnoea, respiratory distress, hypoxia; fever (more frequent in children); pulmonary infiltrate on chest\nx-ray. Often proceeded by a VOC.\nComplications: multiorgan failure (lung, liver, kidney).\nPriapism\nPainful prolonged erection in the absence of sexual stimulation, also occurring in young boys. Risk of necrosis and\nirreversible erectile dysfunction.\nLaboratory and other investigations\nDiagnosis\nHb electrophoresis confirms the diagnosis but is often unavailable.\nIf not available, a positive Emmel test (or sickling test) in the presence of clinical signs of sickle cell disease\nsupports the diagnosis.\nOther examinations\nTests Indications\nHaemoglobin \u2022 At the time of diagnosis and annually (frequently 7 to 9 g/dl).\n\u2022 In case of VOC, fever, acute anaemia (\u2264 5 g/dl or drop in Hb \u2265 2 g/dl below the\npatient\u2019s baseline), stroke, ACS.\n\u2022 For monitoring of transfused patients.\nPlatelets \u2022 At the time of diagnosis and annually.\n\u2022 In case of acute anaemia (thrombocytopenia - platelet count \u2264 100 000/mm3 if\nsplenic sequestration).\nUrine dipstick \u2022 In case of fever: look for a urinary tract infection.\n\u2022 In case of acute severe anaemia: look for haemoglobinuria.\nMalaria test In case of VOC, fever, acute anaemia or stroke.\nLumbar puncture In case of fever with meningeal signs or unexplained coma.\nOther \u2022 Complete blood count and reticulocyte count.\n(if available) \u2022 Blood culture in case of fever.\n\u2022 X-ray if suspicion of pneumonia, osteomyelitis, ACS.\nManagement of major acute manifestations\nPage 37 8/ 409\nPainful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC)\nModerate pain (at home):\nGenerous oral hydration (water, soup, juice, coconut water): minimum 100 ml/kg daily in children and 50 ml/kg\ndaily in adults (2.5 to 3 litres daily);\nWarm compresses (application of cold is contra-indicated);\nLevel 1 (paracetamol and ibuprofen) and level 2 (tramadol) analgesics;\nIf pain is not controlled at home within 24 hours, seek medical attention.\nSevere pain or pain not controlled at home (in hospital):\nPO hydration (as above); if the patient is unable to drink sufficiently, IV hydration (Appendix 1); in the event of\ndehydration, treat according to the degree of dehydration (see Dehydration, Chapter 1);\nLevel 3 analgesics (morphine);\nDo not give routine antibiotics in the absence of fever; do not transfuse for VOC.\nFor the treatment of pain according to intensity, see Pain (Chapter 1).\nFever and infection\nAdmit to hospital:\nAll children less than 2 years;\nChildren with fever \u2265 38.5 \u00b0C and adults with fever \u2265 39.5 \u00b0C; patients who are critically ill appearing a or have\nacute anaemia.\nPO or IV hydration (Appendix 1).\nTreat malaria if present.\nTreat bacterial infections according to cause.\nTreat all patients with respiratory symptoms for pneumonia and ACS.\nIn case of osteomyelitis:\nceftriaxone slow IV b injection (3 minutes) or IV infusion (30 minutes)\nChildren < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg every 12 hours\nChildren \u2265 40 kg and adults: 2 g every 12 hours\n+ cloxacillin IV infusion (60 minutes) c\nChildren < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours\nChildren \u2265 40 kg and adults: 3 g every 6 hours\nAdminister IV therapy for at least 14 days.

They are\nalso at risk of mental, behavioural or cognitive disorders as well as seizure-related injuries. Management of\ncomorbidities and patient/family education and support are essential.\nSeizures are usually short episodes. A seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes (or 2 or more seizures in 5 minutes without\ncomplete restoration of baseline consciousness between seizures) is a medical emergency, see Generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures and convulsive status epilepticus, Chapter 1.\nClinical features\nManifestations of epilepsy (i.e. seizures) are varied. It is critical to recognize the type of seizure to determine patient\nmanagement.\nSeizures are classified as follows [1] :\nGeneralized onset seizures\nTonic-clonic seizures: contraction of muscles, including respiratory muscles (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic\njerking of the arms and legs (clonic phase) and loss of consciousness;\nMyoclonic seizures: sudden and brief contractions of a muscle or group of muscles;\nAtonic seizures: sudden loss of muscle tone, frequently resulting in falls;\nAbsence seizures: brief (a few seconds) impairment of consciousness and cessation of activity; most common in\nchildren from 4 years of age.\nFocal onset seizures\nStart with localised symptoms (e.g. jerking movements of one body part or repetitive lips smacking) and sometimes\nspread to the rest of the body, becoming generalised.\nEpilepsy is clinically diagnosed when 2 or more \"unprovoked\" seizures (i.e. seizures not caused by a temporary\nreversible condition) of any type occur more than 24 hours apart [2] [3] .\nTreatment principles\nOnce the diagnosis of epilepsy (or seizures requiring long-term treatment) has been made, an antiseizure medication\n(ASM) is prescribed to prevent the occurrence of new seizures.\nThe treatment prescribed should be a monotherapy (i.e. a single ASM).\nFor choosing an ASM, see Choice of an antiseizure medication. The likelihood of continued ASM availability should\nalso be considered when making the choice.\nTreatment should be taken daily without interruption for the long term. Abruptly stopping or reducing an ASM dose is\nlikely to provoke seizures.\nLong-term patient follow-up is required, see Patient follow-up. Any change in treatment (dose increments, ASM\nsubstitution or discontinuation) requires close clinical monitoring.\nRarely, ASMs may cause a paradoxical increase in seizure frequency, mainly at the start of treatment or after an\nincrease in dose.\nIf seizures are not controlled, assess adherence to treatment, consider increasing the dose if tolerated, up to the\nmaximum dose if necessary.\nPage 38 4/ 409\nIf seizures are still not controlled or treatment is not tolerated, gradually change to another ASM (slowly increase\nthe dose of the new ASM then slowly decrease the dose of the first ASM until complete substitution).\nCombination therapy should be considered only if two different ASMs used in monotherapy have failed.\nStopping an antiseizure treatment may be considered when the patient has been seizure-free for at least 2 years [4]\n. The benefits/risks of stopping the ASM should be discussed with the patient (seizures may recur after stopping\ntreatment). The dose should be slowly tapered (e.g. by 10% every 2 weeks) over a period of at least 3 months.\nPatients should seek medical attention if seizures recur during or after stopping treatment.\nPatient and family education is essential. Provide information about epilepsy as a disease, the benefits of\ntreatment, ways to maximize control (including adherence to treatment) and first aid for seizures. Explain that\npeople with epilepsy can lead normal lives when certain safety measures are taken (e.g. not swimming alone, not\ncooking over open flames) [4] [5] .\nChoice of an antiseizure medication\nAn ASM is selected according to:\nthe type of seizure: some ASMs may exacerbate some symptoms,\nthe patient\u2019s characteristics: age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, comorbidities, and related treatments,\nthe ASM\u2019s adverse effect profile: in general, newer ASMs (e.g. levetiracetam) are safer, better tolerated, and have\nfewer drug interactions than older ASMs (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid).\nAge/Type of seizures First choice Second choice Third choice\nChildren 1 month to < 2 years\nMotor, generalised carbamazepine (CBZ)\nlevetiracetam (LEV) phenobarbital (PB)\n(tonic-clonic, myoclonic (a) , atonic (b) ) or phenytoin (PHT)\nNon-motor, generalised (absence) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nFocal (partial) LEV or CBZ PB or PHT \u2013\nGirls 2 to < 10 years, boys \u2265 2 years and men\nMotor, generalised LEV or CBZ or PB\n\u2013\n(tonic-clonic, myoclonic (a) , atonic (b) ) valproic acid (VPA) or PHT\nNon-motor, generalised (absence (c) ) LEV or VPA \u2013 \u2013\nFocal (partial) LEV or CBZ VPA PB or PHT\nGirls \u2265 10 years and women\nMotor, generalised\nLEV CBZ or PHT PB\n(tonic-clonic, myoclonics (a) , atonic (b) )\nNon-motoras, generalised (absence (c) ) LEV \u2013 \u2013\nFocal (partial) LEV CBZ or PHT PB\nPage 38 5/ 409\n(a) For myoclonic seizures: CBZ and PHT are not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms).\n(b) For atonic seizures: CBZ is not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms).\n(c) For absence seizures: CBZ, PB and PHT are not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms).\nChildren\nVPA is contraindicated in children less than 2 years (increased risk of hepatotoxicity).\nPatients over 65 years\nLEV is preferred in older patients [6] .\nPregnant women and girls\nThe risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) is lower with monotherapy than with combined therapy [7] .\nASMs that can be used during pregnancy include:\nLEV: first-line, safest ASM with the lowest risk of MCM [7] [8] .\nASMs other than LEV (only if LEV is not available):\nCBZ and PHT: associated with an intermediate risk of MCM [7] [8] ;\nPB: associated with a high risk of MCM [7] [8] and small for gestational age.\nIf taking ASM treatment before pregnancy:\nLEV: continue treatment under closer monitoring.\nASMs other than LEV:\nThe benefits/risks of substitution for a safer ASM should be discussed with patients.\nSubstitution may be beneficial for the foetus but may also be a risk for the mother and the foetus if it results\nin loss of seizure control. The term of pregnancy should be taken into account. For substitution with a safer\nASM, see Treatment principles. A substitution frequently takes 2 to 3 months.\nVPA must not be prescribed in pregnant women and girls. It is associated with the highest risk of MCM and\nneurodevelopmental disorders in children exposed in utero [7] [8] . In situations where VPA would be the only option,\ndivide doses over the day to minimize peaks in VPA plasma concentrations.\nIn all cases:\nThe parents should be informed of current knowledge in terms of risks for the unborn child, in particular when the risk\nof foetotoxicity is high.\nAdminister the lower effective dose (foetal harms are mainly dose-dependent).\nASM plasma concentrations may decrease during pregnancy. If the dose needs to be increased antepartum, start\nreducing it from D3-D4 postpartum to gradually return to the dose effective before pregnancy.\nStart taking high dose folic acid to reduce the risk of MCM (5 mg daily for the first trimester [9] a ).\nAfter pregnancy, the benefits of breastfeeding are considered to outweigh the risk of adverse effects of ASMs [10] .\nWomen and girls of childbearing age\nThe choice of an ASM is based on the same criteria as per pregnant women and girls due to the possibility of\nundiagnosed or future pregnancies.\nPreconception and/or contraception counselling should be offered.\nIf considering pregnancy, depending on the ASM currently taken, consider a safer ASM.\nWhen planning pregnancy, start taking folic acid before conception to reduce the risk of MCM.\nIf no pregnancy is planned, effective contraception should be provided:\nPatient taking CBZ, PB or PHT: injectable medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) or levonorgestrel-containing or\ncopper intrauterine device [7] .\nPatient taking LEV or VPA: as above, but contraceptive implants and oral contraceptives can also be used [7] .\nPage 38 6/ 409\nIn situations where VPA would be the only effective option (i.e. after confirmation that other ASMs are ineffective\nor poorly tolerated), a blood pregnancy test should be performed before starting the treatment, then regularly if the\npatient is not on effective contraception.\nIf pregnancy occurs, see Pregnant women and girls.\nDosage of antiseizure medications\nStart with a low dose then increase gradually based on patient's response (seizure control) and tolerance (occurrence\nof adverse effects). The following doses are given as a guide and should be ajusted individually.\ncarbamazepine PO:\nChildren 1 month to 11 years: start with 5 mg/kg once daily or 2.5 mg/kg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose by\nincrements of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg every 3 to 7 days, up to 5 mg/kg 2 or 3 times daily if necessary (max. 20 mg/kg daily).\nChildren 12 years and over: start with 100 to 200 mg once daily or 50 to 100 mg 2 times daily; increase the daily\ndose by increments of 100 to 200 mg every week, up to 200 to 400 mg 2 or 3 times daily if necessary (max. 1800\nmg daily).\nAdults: start with 100 to 200 mg once daily or 50 to 100 mg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose by\nincrements of 100 to 200 mg every week, up to 400 mg 2 or 3 times daily if necessary (max. 2 g daily).\nlevetiracetam PO:\nChildren 1 to 5 months: start with 7 mg/kg once daily; increase to 7 mg/kg 2 times daily after 2 weeks, then by\nincrements of 7 mg/kg 2 times daily every 2 weeks if necessary (max. 21 mg/kg 2 times daily).\nChildren 6 months to 17 years (< 50 kg): start with 10 mg/kg once daily; increase to 10 mg/kg 2 times daily after 2\nweeks, then by increments of 10 mg/kg 2 times daily every 2 weeks if necessary (max. 30 mg/kg 2 times daily).\nChildren 50 kg and over and adult: start with 250 mg 2 times daily; increase to 500 mg 2 times daily after 2 to 4\nweeks, then by increments of 500 mg 2 times daily every 2 to 4 weeks if necessary (max. 1.5 g 2 times daily).\nphenobarbital PO:\nChildren 1 month to 11 years: start with 2 to 3 mg/kg once daily at bedtime or 1 to 1.5 mg/kg 2 times daily for 2\nweeks; increase the daily dose by increments of 1 to 2 mg/kg every week, up to 2 to 6 mg/kg once daily if\nnecessary.\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: start with 1 mg/kg (max. 60 mg) once daily at bedtime for 2 weeks; increase\nthe daily dose by increments of 15 to 30 mg every week, up to 3 mg/kg once daily if needed (max. 180 mg daily).\nphenytoin PO:\nChildren 1 month to 11 years: start with 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose by increments of 5\nmg/kg every 3 to 4 weeks, up to 2.5 to 5 mg/kg 2 times daily if necessary (max. 7.5 mg/kg 2 times daily or 300 mg\ndaily).\nChildren 12 years and over: start with 75 to 150 mg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose by increments of 25 mg\nevery 3 to 4 weeks, up to 150 to 200 mg 2 times daily if necessary (max. 300 mg 2 times daily).\nAdults: start with 150 to 300 mg once daily or 75 to 150 mg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose by increments of\n50 mg every 3 to 4 weeks, up to 200 to 400 mg once daily or 100 to 250 mg 2 times daily if necessary (max. 400 mg\nonce daily or 300 mg 2 times daily).\nvalproic acid (sodium valproate) PO:\nChildren 2 to 11 years: start with 10 to 15 mg/kg once daily or 5 to 7.5 mg/kg 2 times daily; increase the daily dose\nby increments of 5 to 10 mg/kg every week, up to 12.5 to 15 mg/kg 2 times daily if necessary (max. 600 mg 2 times\ndaily).\nChildren 12 years and over and adults: start with 500 to 600 mg once daily; increase the daily dose by increments of\n200 mg every 3 days, up to 500 mg to 1 g 2 times daily if necessary (max. 2.5 g daily).\nPatient follow-up\nPage 38 7/ 409\nThe initial follow-up schedule is guided by titration of the prescribed ASM.\nOnce seizures are controlled for at least 1 month, follow-up can be spaced out to 3 months, then every 6 months if the\npatient is stable.\nEncourage maintaining a seizure diary if possible.\nAt each consultation:\nAssess:\nGrowth and development in children.\nTreatment :\nresponse (seizure frequency) and tolerance (adverse effects),\nimpact on daily life (e.g. time off school or work).\nAdherence to treatment.\nCo-morbidities, including associated anxiety or depression.\nAdjust the dose of the ASM if necessary.

[1]\nType 2 diabetes can lead to acute complications, as well as chronic complications that result in serious organ damage\n(cardiovascular events; diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy).\nClinical features\nFew or no symptoms; symptoms of hyperglycaemia may be present: polyuria (frequent urination) and polydypsia\n(excessive thirst and drinking).\nIn rare cases, patients may present with severe hyperglycaemia (impaired consciousness, coma or acute\ndehydration).\nDiagnosis\nLook for diabetes in the event of:\nsymptoms of hyperglycaemia;\ncardiovascular disorders: stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension;\nperipheral neuropathies, foot ulcers, absence of tendon reflexes or peripheral pulse.\nDiagnosis is made on one of the following results a [1] [2] :\nTests Symptomatic patient Asymptomatic patient\nFasting blood glucose (a) 1 fasting blood glucose 2 fasting blood glucose\n\u2265 7 mmol/litre (\u2265 126 mg/dl) \u2265 7 mmol/litre (\u2265 126 mg/dl)\nRandom blood glucose (b) 1 random blood glucose See tablenote (b)\n\u2265 11 mmol/litre (\u2265 200 mg/dl)\nPost-load blood glucose (c) 1 post-load blood glucose: 2 post-load blood glucose:\non venous blood on venous blood\n\u2265 11 mmol/litre (\u2265 200 mg/dl) \u2265 11 mmol/litre (\u2265 200 mg/dl)\nor or\non capillary blood on capillary blood\n\u2265 12.2 mmol/litre (\u2265 220 mg/dl) \u2265 12.2 mmol/litre (\u2265 220 mg/dl)\nGlycated Hb (HbA1c) (d) 1 HbA1c \u2265 6.5% 2 HbA1c \u2265 6.5%\n(a) Fasting blood glucose test: performed on patient that has fasted at least 8 hours. Values are the same for venous and\ncapillary blood.\n(b) Random blood glucose test: performed at any moment of the day. Values are for venous blood only.\nFor asymptomatic patients, it is not recommended to perform 2 random blood glucose tests. If the first test is a random\nblood glucose, the second test should be a fasting blood glucose.\n(c) Post-load blood glucose test: performed 2 hours after oral ingestion of 75 g glucose (one sachet of 75 g anhydrous\nglucose powder dissolved in 200 to 300 ml of water, to be drunk within 10 minutes).\nPage 39 0/ 409\n(d) Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c): reflects average glycaemia over around 3 months.\nPerform urine dipstick analysis for ketones if:\nfasting blood glucose \u2265 15 mmol/litre (\u2265 270 mg/dl) and symptoms of hyperglycemia,\nor\nfasting or random blood glucose \u2265 18 mmol/litre (\u2265 325 mg/dl) even without symptoms.\nRefer the patient if acute complications (such as hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis) are present.\nTreatment\nGlycaemic targets\nFasting blood glucose \u2264 7 mmol/litre (\u2264 126 mg/dl) or HbA1c of 7%. [3]\nThe closer blood glucose levels remain to these values, the more cardiovascular complications are prevented or\ndelayed.\nDepending on the context (healthcare provision) or patient profile (older patient, history of severe hypoglycaemia or\nlong-standing poorly controlled diabetes), HbA1c \u2264 8% [2] is acceptable.\nBlood glucose should not fall < 4.5 mmol/litre (or < 80 mg/dl) or HbA1c < 6.5%.\nLifestyle and dietary advice b\nAvoid sugared foods and drinks (but no excessive restriction of carbohydrates).\nHigh fibre intake; limit animal fats and alcohol.\nPhysical activity.\nWeight control. If BMI \u2265 25, try to reduce weight by 5 to 10%.\nStop smoking.\nPharmacological treatment\nFirst-line treatment metformin PO c .\nThe usual dose is 1 to 2 g daily.

For information:\nWeek 1: 2.5 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast\nWeek 2: 5 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast\nIncrease in increments of 2.5 mg weekly until fasting blood glucose reaches target levels (max.15 mg daily).\nIn patients over 60, gliclazide PO (immediate release tablet):\nThe usual dose is 40 to 80 mg 2 times daily. For information:\nWeeks 1 and 2: 40 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast\nIncrease in increments of 40 mg every 2 weeks (weeks 3 and 4: 80 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast) until\nfasting blood glucose reaches target levels (max. 240 mg daily, i.e. 120 mg morning and evening).\nPage 39 1/ 409\nIf glycaemic control is not acheived with the combination of metformin + a sulfonylurea, continue metformin but\nreplace the sulfonylurea with intermediate-acting insulin SC: start with 0.2 IU/kg at bedtime.

Endemic goitre occurs in iodine-deficient areas. Goitre can also be\ncaused or aggravated by the regular consumption of goitrogens such as manioc, cabbage, turnips, millet etc.\nGoitre is an adaptive process: iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones; iodine deficiency impairs\nthyroid hormone synthesis; to compensate, the thyroid gland increases in volume. Thyroid function usually remains\nnormal.\nAs well as the development of goitre, iodine deficiency in pregnant women has serious consequences for the child\n(foetal and perinatal mortality, physical and mental retardation, cretinism). These risks must be prevented by providing\niodine supplementation in iodinedeficient areas.\nClinical features\nThe WHO proposes a simplified classification based on the significance of goitre:\nGroup 0: normal thyroid, no palpable or visible goitre\nGroup 1: enlarged thyroid, palpable but not visible when the neck is in the normal position\nGroup 2: thyroid clearly visible when the neck is in the normal position\nPossible mechanical complications (rare): compression, deviation of the trachea or of the oesophagus.\nPrevention and treatment\nThe objective of prevention is to reduce the consequences of iodine deficiency in neonates and children. Supplying\niodised salt through national programmes is the recommended method of prevention.\nFor prevention in populations living in iodine deficient areas where iodised salt is not available and for curative\ntreatment of patients with goitre: use iodised oil, according to national protocols. For information (according to the\nWHO):\nIodised oil PO\nPopulation once yearly\n(190 mg capsule)\nChildren under 1 year 1 capsule\nChildren from 1 to < 6 years 2 capsules\nChildren from 6 to 15 years 3 capsules\nPregnant or lactating women\n2 capsules\nor women of childbearing age\nCurative and preventive single-doses are the same. Oral treatment is preferred. The target populations are pregnant\nand breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age and children.\nIn children, goitre disappears after several months. It disappears more slowly (or never) in adults despite restoration of\nnormal thyroid function in 2 weeks. Surgery is only indicated for patients with local mechanical dysfunction.\nPage 40 4/ 409\nAppendices\nAppendix 1.
