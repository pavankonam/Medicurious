this guide is designed for use by medical professionals involved in curative care at the dispensary and primary hospital. we have tried to respond in the simplest and most practical way possible to the questions and problems faced by field medical staff, using the accumulated field experience of médecins sans frontières, the recommendations of reference organizations such as the world health organization (who) and specialized works in each field. this edition touches on the curative and, to a lesser extent, the preventive aspects of the main diseases encountered in the field. the list is incomplete, but covers the essential needs. this guide is used not only in programmes supported by médecins sans frontières, but also in other programmes and in other contexts. it is notably an integral part of the who emergency health kit. médecins sans frontières has also issued french, spanish and arabic editions. editions in other languages have also been produced in the field. this guide is a collaborative effort of medical professionals from many disciplines, all with field experience. despite all efforts, it is possible that certain errors may have been overlooked in this guide. please inform the authors of any errors detected. it is important to remember, that if in doubt, it is the responsibility of the prescribing medical professional to ensure that the doses indicated in this manual conform to the manufacturer ’s specifications. to ensure that this guide continues to evolve while remaining adapted to field realities, please send any comments or suggestions. as treatment protocols are regularly revised, please check the monthly updates. page 5 / 409abbreviations and acronyms last update: october 2023 page 6 / 409ace angiotensin converting

perfusion and inadequate oxygen delivery. prolonged shock can result in cellular dysfunction and irreversible organ failure. mortality is high without early diagnosis and treatment. clinical features shock should be suspected in patients with: sign(s) of hypotension: weak pulse, low or declining blood pressure (bp) a , narrow pulse pressure acute onset of signs of tissue hypoperfusion: skin: pallor, mottled skin, sweating, cold extremities or lower limb temperature gradient b , capillary refill time (crt) ≥ 3 seconds lungs: tachypnea, dyspnoea heart: tachycardia, which often occurs before bp decreases kidney: oliguria (urine output < 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hour) or anuria brain: thirst, anxiety, agitation, confusional state, apathy, altered mental status in children, accurate bp measurement is difficult, and hypotension is a very late sign of shock. therefore, critically ill children c should be treated for shock if they present at least one of the following signs: lower limb temperature gradient b , crt ≥ 3 seconds, weak radial pulse or severe tachycardia d [1] . clinical features may vary according to the type of shock [2] : page 11 / 409type specific clinical features risk factors anaphylaxis: likely when either of the following 2 recent exposure to an allergen criteria develop within minutes to hours [3] : (e.g. food, sting, medicine) or involvement of skin and/or mucous membranes (e.g. history of anaphylaxis generalised urticaria, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) and ≥ 1 of the following: respiratory symptoms (wheeze, dyspnoea); distributive low bp or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction severe vasodilation (hypotonia, incontinence); and increased capillary severe gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal permeability resulting pain, repetitive vomiting). in maldistribution of hypotension, bronchospasm or laryngeal blood flow involvement (stridor, vocal changes, odynophagia) after exposure to known or probable allergen for that patient. septic shock: signs of infection, fever or infection, recent surgery, hypothermia, altered mental status, dyspnoea, immunodeficiency persisting hypotension despite fluid resuscitation [4] ischaemia: chest pain, dyspnoea history of cardiac disease, arrhythmia advanced age cardiogenic murmur of valvular heart disease cardiac pump failure acute heart failure: see heart failure in adults, chapter history of cardiac disease, viral 12. illness, immunodeficiency hypovolaemic haemorrhagic: external bleeding, signs and symptoms trauma, recent surgery, obstetric direct blood/fluid loss of internal bleeding, hypotension (a) haemorrhage or fluid sequestration into the extravascular non-haemorrhagic: dry mouth, absence of tears, profuse diarrhoea and/or space resulting in sunken eyes/fontanelle, low jugular venous pressure vomiting, intestinal obstruction decreased (jvp), altered mental status intravascular volume pulmonary embolism (pe): chest pain, tachycardia, recent surgery or immobilisation, tachypnoea, hypoxia cancer, history of pe or dvt deep vein thrombosis (dvt): leg pain, swelling, warmth obstructive obstruction to blood tension pneumothorax: decreased breath sounds, trauma, invasive medical flow to, or from, the raised jvp, weak radial pulse, tracheal deviation procedure heart or great vessels cardiac tamponade: pulsus paradoxus (b) , raised jvp, trauma, immunodeficiency narrow pulse pressure, muffled heart sounds (a) in children and young adults with hypovolaemic shock, bp may be maintained initially, but subsequently declines rapidly if fluid loss is not replaced. page 12 / 409(b) pulsus paradoxus is measured by taking the patient's bp during both expiration and inspiration. it is defined as a decrease of > 10 mmhg in the sbp during inspiration compared with expiration. management attend to the patient immediately even if the type of shock is not known. call for help. move to critical care unit if possible. assess and manage a (airway), b (breathing), and c (circulation) according to basic life support (see below). if anaphylaxis is suspected, immediately go to specific management. take a rapid history to try to determine underlying cause. monitor: urine output hourly (insert a urinary catheter) hr, rr, bp, temperature, crt, spo , and level of consciousness 2 perform the following tests: haemoglobin and blood glucose level malaria rapid diagnostic test in endemic area: see malaria, chapter 6 blood culture (if available) and blood group in children, administer ceftriaxone iv e : one dose of 80 mg/kg. reassess need for further antibiotic treatment according to underlying cause. treat pain: see pain, chapter 1. primary objective of shock management is to restore adequate tissue perfusion, demonstrated by: returning vital signs, crt, spo , mental status, etc. to normal. 2 maintaining mean arterial pressure (map) f > 65 mmhg in adults (or higher if patient has pre-existing hypertension). maintaining urine output > 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hour. after initial management: take a more detailed history. perform a comprehensive physical examination. in case of dehydration: see dehydration, chapter 1. in case of blunt thoracic or abdominal trauma, perform pocus g : (e)fast exam to evaluate for pneumothorax or free fluid in pleural, pericardial and/or peritoneal spaces. refer to surgeon as required. on-going care: re-evaluate patient’s condition and response to treatment every 10 minutes until patient is stable. perform a second comprehensive physical examination. initiate nutritional support adapted to patient's needs as soon as possible and reassess regularly. patients have high protein and energy requirements. enteral route is preferred. basic life support 1) manage airways and breathing lay the patient on their back. however: if spinal trauma is suspected, do not move the patient; in case of anaphylaxis, the patient may prefer a sitting position. in case of altered mental status: be prepared with mask and bag if needed for ventilation; remove any airway obstruction (e.g. secretions, foreign body); open airway: stand at head of bed, place one hand on the forehead and gently tilt the head back. simultaneously, place the fingertips of the other hand under the chin and lift the chin. if suspicion of spinal trauma, do not move the neck. instead, place heels of both hands on patient’s parietal areas, and use index and middle fingers of both hands to push the angle of mandible anteriorly (jaw thrust) page 13 / 409if needed, insert an oropharyngeal airway. auscultate lungs to assess ventilation. administer 10 to 15 litres/minute of oxygen with mask to maintain spo > 94%. 2 if spo remains ≤ 94% with oxygen, see if resources allow. 2 2) maintain circulation control bleeding: apply direct manual pressure and/or compression/haemostatic dressing to the wound; in case of massive life-threatening bleeding from an extremity (e.g. leg) not controlled by direct pressure: apply a windlass tourniquet h [5] . insert 2 peripheral iv lines (catheters 20-22g in children and 14-18g in adults) or an intraosseous (io) needle. administer ringer lactate (rl) i , glucose 5%-ringer lactate (g5%-rl) j , and/or blood, following specific management described below. reassess before giving additional fluid therapy. monitor for fluid overload k , especially in patients at risk, e.g. severely malnourished children; patients with severe malaria, heart disease, severe anaemia; older patients. maintain normal body temperature. if unable to maintain bp, see if resources allow. anaphylaxis remove exposure to causal agent. administer epinephrine (adrenaline) im into the mid-anterolateral thigh. use undiluted solution and a 1 ml syringe graduated in 0.01 ml [6] : children under 6 months: 0.1 to 0.15 ml children 6 months to 5 years: 0.15 ml children 6 to 12 years: 0.3 ml children over 12 years l and adults: 0.5 ml repeat after 5 minutes if no or poor clinical improvement (up to a total of 3 im injections). monitor hr, bp, crt and clinical response. in case of stridor, administer nebulized epinephrine: 0.5 mg/kg/dose (max. 5 mg) in 5 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride over 10 to 15 minutes if spo is < 94%, ventilate with bag mask. 2 administer a bolus of rl: children: 10 ml/kg as quickly as possible adults: 500 ml as quickly as possible repeat bolus once if signs of poor perfusion persist after 15 minutes. if shock persists after 3 im injections of epinephrine, in particular if unable to maintain bp, see if ressources allow. after initial treatment with epinephrine and iv fluids, some patients (e.g. patients requiring continuing treatment after 2 doses of epinephrine im or patients with ongoing asthma or shock) may benefit from a short course of corticosteroid therapy. when the patient is stable, prednisolone po : 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) once daily in the morning for 3 to 5 days. use an iv corticosteroid only if the patient cannot take oral treatment. septic shock look for source of infection. if possible, take specimens for culture before starting antibiotic treatment. fluid therapy: children and adolescents under 15 years: g5%-rl solution as maintenance fluids (see appendix 1) adolescents 15 years and over and adults: one bolus of 250 to 500 ml of rl as quickly as possible antibiotic treatment: start antibiotics according to the suspected origin of infection within 1 hour of presentation [7] (see tables below). page 14 / 409if source is unknown, administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. if possible, take into account local epidemiology (rates and types of resistance). differentiate community acquired sepsis and nosocomial sepsis as pathogens and rates of resistance may be different. simplify the antibiotic treatment (to narrower spectrum) whenever possible. reassess treatment daily: if culture results are available: adapt treatment accordingly. if improvement after 24 to 48 hours: change to oral route, however some foci (e.g. meningitis) require prolonged iv treatment. if no improvement after 48 to 96 hours: consider resistant pathogen m , in particular in patients with immunodeficiency or recent (in the last month) hospitalisation or antibiotic use and adapt treatment accordingly. other measures to control infection: if suspected catheter-related infection, insert a new catheter in another site and remove the suspected catheter. drain soft-tissue abscess (see cutaneous abscess, chapter 10); irrigate and debride traumatic wounds. refer to surgeon if needed for debridement, drainage, relieving obstruction, etc. treatment of fever: see fever, chapter 1. page 15 / 409origin antibiotics alternatives (c) cloxacillin

a large peripheral iv catheter n (proximal forearm or above), a central venous catheter or an io line dedicated to the infusion; use of an electric syringe or pump to control flow rate o ; intensive monitoring of drug administration, particularly during syringe changes. all infused volumes must be accounted for when recording fluid balance. these protocols are for peripheral iv administration. titrate according to patient's clinical situation. refer to management objectives (including bp) under management. norepinephrine (nep) tartrate (i) epinephrine (epn) (adrenaline) children: 2nd choice children: 1st choice indication adults: 1st choice adults: 2nd choice children: children: add 1 ml (2 mg) of nep tartrate to 39 ml add 2 ml (2 mg) of epn to 38 ml of 0.9% nacl of 0.9% nacl to obtain a 0.05 mg/ml (50 to obtain a 0.05 mg/ml (50 micrograms/ml) preparation micrograms/ml) solution. solution. of diluted adults: adults: solution (j) add 2 ml (4 mg) of nep tartrate to 38 ml add 4 ml (4 mg) of epn to 36 ml of 0.9% nacl of 0.9% nacl to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml (100 to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml (100 micrograms/ml) micrograms/ml) solution. solution. starting 0.1 microgram/kg/minute rate (k) rate for increase by 0.05 micrograms/kg/minute every 10 minutes for the first hour, then every hour. increasing (k) max. 1 microgram/kg/minute. rate for taper down doses when management objectives are attained. do not stop abruptly. decreasing (k) decrease by 0.05 micrograms/kg/minute every hour. (i) 2 mg of nep tartrate = 1 mg of nep base. (j) 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose or rl can be used for dilution. (k) the infusion rate is calculated as follows: [desired dose (microgram/kg/min) x weight (kg) x 60 min] ÷ concentration (microgram/ml). ongoing care: measure serum potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate levels and correct any abnormalities. additional investigations (e.g. x-rays, other laboratory tests) may be indicated, depending on aetiology suspected. page 19 / 409footnotes (a) hypotension is based on systolic blood pressure (sbp) in adults: sbp < 90 mmhg or decrease in sbp ≥ 40 mmhg from baseline or mean arterial pressure map < 65 mmhg. shock is often accompanied by hypotension but may also occur with normal or elevated bp. (b) run the back of the hand from the toe to the knee. a notable temperature change from the cold foot to the warm knee is a positive temperature gradient, indicating distal hypoperfusion. (c) critically ill-appearing child: weak grunting or crying, drowsy and difficult to arouse, does not smile, disconjugate or anxious gaze, pallor or cyanosis, general hypotonia. (d) children under 1 year: > 180 bpm; children 1 to 5 years: > 160 bpm; children 5 years and over: > 140 bpm. (e) for iv administration of ceftriaxone, dissolve only in water for injection. (f) map = diastolic bp (dbp) + 1/3 (sbp-dbp). a patient with bp 90/60 has a map = 60 + 1/3 (90-60) = 70. (g) pocus should only be performed and interpreted by trained clinicians. (h) the patient should receive surgery within 1 hour of the application of a windlass tourniquet. after 1 hour, there is a risk of ischaemic injury of the limb. if surgery is not possible and the tourniquet is required to save the patient’s life, it should be left in place. any tourniquet that has been applied for more than 6 hours should be left in place until arrival at a facility capable of providing definitive surgical care. (i) crystalloids should be used. colloids (e.g. modified fluid gelatin, albumin) are not recommended. (j) remove 50 ml of rl from a 500 ml rl bottle or bag, then add 50 ml of 50% glucose to the remaining 450 ml of rl to obtain 500 ml of 5% glucose-rl solution. (k) in case of fluid overload: sit the patient up, reduce the infusion rate to a minimum and administer furosemide iv (0.5 mg/kg in children; 40 mg in adults). monitor the patient closely over 30 minutes and assess for underlying cardiorespiratory or renal disease. once the patient is stabilised, reassess the necessity of continuing iv fluids. if iv fluids are still required, re-start at half the previous infusion rate and monitor closely. (l) if small or prepubertal children, administer 0.3 ml of epinephrine. (m) for example: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas species, and gram-negative bacteria with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) activity. (n) when using a peripheral vein, monitor infusion site closely for signs of extravasation, in particular in young children. (o) if no system to control volume delivery and flow rate (e.g. syringe pump), an infusion using an infusion bag and standard paediatric giving set can be considered in extreme situations as a temporary measure. however, it is important to consider the risks related to this type of administration (accidental bolus or insufficient dose). the infusion must be constantly monitored to prevent any, even small, change from the prescribed rate. references 1. houston ka, george ec, maitland k. implications for paediatric shock management in resource-limited settings: a perspective from the

generalised tonic-clonic seizures are involuntary movements of both sides of the body associated with impaired or loss of consciousness. they result from abnormal brain activity. most seizures are brief (less than 5 minutes) and resolve spontaneously. they may occur once or may recur. in young children, seizures frequently occur in the context of fever, with no underlying causes. these are defined as "febrile seizures". a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or 2 or more seizures in 5 minutes without complete restoration of baseline consciousness between seizures is defined as "status epilepticus" [1] [2] . status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring immediate management. the longer a seizure lasts, the more difficult it is to stop, and the greater the risk for permanent brain damage and death. in pregnancy and the postpartum period, seizures may be a manifestation of eclampsia. refer to essential obstetric and newborn care, msf. clinical features during a seizure contraction of muscles, including respiratory muscles (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic jerking of the arms and legs (clonic phase) and loss of consciousness these signs may be associated with loss of urine, breathing difficulty, and cyanosis. immediately after a seizure (postictal phase) the patient experiences fatigue and temporary symptoms such as confusional state, headache, memory loss, focal deficits. recovery usually occurs within 30 to 60 minutes [3] but may be delayed. first aid during a seizure note the time. call for help. protect from falls and trauma, loosen clothing. maintain airway, place patient in recovery position to avoid aspiration, do not put anything in the mouth. treat hypoglycaemia if present or administer glucose if unable to measure capillary blood glucose immediately (see hypoglycaemia, chapter 1). depending on the context: administer oxygen if available. if febrile seizures are likely, see febrile seizures. in adults, thiamine (100 mg by iv infusion in 100 ml 0.9% nacl over 30 minutes) may be administered at the same time as glucose if vitamin b deficiency is suspected (e.g. in case of alcohol-related seizures) a . 1 if seizures stop spontaneously in 5 minutes or less, see postictal management. febrile seizures page 22 / 409febrile seizures frequently occur in children aged 6 months to 5 years with fever (usually due to viral infection) and no signs of central nervous system (cns) infection, metabolic disturbances, or history of afebrile seizures [4] . they may be either "simple" or "complex". a simple febrile seizure is defined as a single generalised seizure, without focal signs, that lasts less than 15 minutes, and does not recur within a 24-hour period [4] . most of these seizures last less than 5 minutes and if so, no antiseizure treatment is required. the risk of subsequent epilepsy is low after this type of seizure. observe the child at least until full recovery, and discharge when child returns to neurological baseline. give instructions for home-based management: symptomatic treatment of fever to make the child more comfortable (see fever, chapter 1) and of underlying viral infection if relevant. a complex febrile seizure is a seizure meeting at least one the following criteria: presence of focal signs, a duration more than 15 minutes, or multiple seizures within a 24-hour period [4] . in all cases: provide first aid during a seizure. after a seizure, see postictal management. if a seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or recurs within 5 minutes, start treatment for status epilepticus. status epilepticus in case of status epilepticus, start antiseizure medication (asm). asms may cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially in children and older patients. during and after asm administration: have ventilation equipment (ambu and mask) and solutions for fluid replacement ready for use, monitor rr, spo , hr, and bp at least every 15 minutes until stable. 2 never administer asms by rapid iv injection. reduce the administration rate in the event of drop in rr, hr, or bp. step 1 - first-line asm treatment administer one of the following benzodiazepines (bzd). the choice depends on the situation, i.e. if seizures occur in pre-hospital or hospital setting. in any case, do not administer more than 2 doses of bzd. status epilepticus in pre-hospital setting administer midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. for doses to be administered, see table 1. if seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of bzd, readminister the same dose. if seizures do not stop after the second dose of bzd, refer urgently to hospital for treatment with second-line asm(s). if seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of bzd, refer to hospital for further management (aetiologic treatment and potential maintenance treatment). while awaiting transfer, monitor vital signs, administer oxygen if available to maintain spo > 94%. if seizures stop, 2 see postictal management. status epilepticus in hospital setting page 23 / 409check whether a bzd has been administered before arrival at the hospital and the number of doses. if one dose was administered, give a second dose. if 2 doses were administered, start step 2 - second-line asm treatment. if no pre-hospital dose of bzd was administered: if iv or io access: diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by slow iv injection (over 3 to 5 minutes). for doses to be administered, see table 1. if no iv or io access: midazolam (5 mg/ml solution) by buccal or intranasal route or midazolam (1 mg/ml solution) by im route or diazepam (5 mg/ml solution) by rectal route. for doses to be administered, see table 1. if seizures do not stop 5 minutes after the first dose of bzd, readminister the same dose. if seizures do not stop after the second dose of bzd, start step 2 - second-line asm treatment. if seizures recur: 6 hours or more after seizures stop, restart treatment from step 1 - first-line asm treatment as for a new seizure, less than 6 hours after seizures stop, continue treatment at the last point, e.g.: if seizures recur < 6 hours after a first dose of bzd, readminister the same dose, if seizures recur < 6 hours after 2 doses of bzd, start step 2 - second-line asm treatment. if seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of bzd and do not recur, see postictal management and evaluate the need for maintenance asm treatment. table 1 - dosage of benzodiazepines age 1 to < 4 4 to < 12 1 to < 3 3 to < 5 5 to < 9 9 to < 12 ≥ 12 years

pushing the syringe plunger. (b) midazolam intranasal route: lay the patient on their back or side. withdraw the required dose using a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe (add an additional 0.1 ml to the calculated dose to account for the remaining liquid in the atomising device). remove the needle. attach the intranasal atomisation device to the syringe. briskly push the syringe plunger to spray the dose into the nostril. the dose can be split in both nostrils to reduce irritation. (c) diazepam rectal route: lay the patient on their side. for volumes up to 1 ml, use a 1 ml syringe. withdraw the required dose. remove the needle. insert the syringe into the rectum for a length of 1 to 3 cm (depending on age) to administer the dose. for volumes greater than 1 ml, use a 2 ml syringe and attach to the tip of the syringe a nasogastric tube n°8 cut to a length of 2 to 3 cm to administer the dose. after administration, hold the buttocks together for at least one minute. page 24 / 409(d) in patients ≥ 65 years: for diazepam rectal, do not exceed 2 ml (= 10 mg) per dose; for diazepam iv, reduce the dose by half (1 ml = 5 mg per dose). step 2 - second-line asm treatment patients with no known epilepsy second-line asms are indicated for: children, if seizures do not stop within 5 minutes of second dose of bzd. all adults, even if seizures stop after 1 or 2 doses of bzd, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances). the choice of the asm depends on the patient’s characteristics: age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, and comorbidities. see table 2. for doses to be administered, see table 3 table 2 - choice of a second-line antiseizure medication children 1 month to < 2 years girls 2 to < 10 years girls ≥ 10 years and women boys ≥ 2 years and men first choice levetiracetam (lev) (e) levetiracetam (lev) (e) or valproic acid (vpa) (f) second choice phenobarbital (pb) (g) phenobarbital (pb) (g) third choice phenytoin (pht) (h) phenytoin (pht) (h) (e) lev can be used in all patients but with caution in patients with renal impairment or heart disorders. (f) vpa is contraindicated: • in children under 2 years and patients with hepatic disease; • in women and girls who are or may become pregnant. every effort should be made to find a safer alternative to vpa in pregnant women and girls. however, prolonged status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition both for the mother and the unborn child. if vpa is the only asm available, use the lowest possible dose. (g) pb is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. it should be administered with caution in children, older patients and patients with mild to moderate impairment of respiratory, renal or hepatic function. (h) pht is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, atrioventricular block. it should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, heart failure, cardiac rhythm disorders, hypotension. if seizures do not stop after second-line asm, change to another second-line asm. if seizures do not stop or recur in < 6 hours despite 2 second-line asms, transfer the patient to an intensive care unit for treatment of refractory status epilepticus. if seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line asm(s), see postictal management and maintenance asm treatment. patients with known epilepsy history taking: asm and dose taken, effectiveness. missed doses if any, and reason (e.g. forgetting, interruption due to adverse effects, shortage of medication). management: administer the iv loading dose of the medication that the patient should usually take or see table 2. page 25 / 409if seizures do not stop, continue treatment as for patients with no known epilepsy. if seizures stop after 1 or 2 second-line asm(s), see postictal management and maintenance asm treatment. step 3 - maintenance asm treatment some patients may require maintenance treatment after the loading dose. in children, maintenance treatment is indicated when: a second-line asm has been used to control seizures, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances), 3 or more seizures occur within a 24-hour period, focal signs and/or impaired consciousness persist beyond expected postictal period, there is known or presumed traumatic brain injury (within 24 hours of injury), there is known or presumed epilepsy. unless the child has already received a loading dose, start with a loading dose, see table 3. in adults, maintenance treatment is indicated for all patients, unless a reversible cause of seizure can be quickly treated (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances). if seizures do not recur, administer maintenance treatment for 48 to 72 hours and then reassess. use oral route (or nasogastric tube). for maintenance doses to be administered, see table 3. for seizures in the context of head trauma, maintenance treatment should last 7 days. in case of epilepsy, start or resume long-term treatment. see epilepsy, chapter 12. postictal management note time of end of seizure; keep patient in recovery position; maintain airway. administer oxygen to all patients if available and especially to patients who received asm(s). maintain spo > 94%. 2 monitor vital signs and spo every 15 minutes until stable, then every hour. 2 closely monitor rr if the patient received bzd, pb or pht; hr and bp (and ecg if available) if the patient received pht. observe for further seizures. as soon as possible, try to identify the underlying cause and treat it, even in patients with known epilepsy (see frequent causes of seizures): take a detailed history and perform a full clinical examination, looking particularly for general status and focal signs. depending on assessment, perform the following tests if available: capillary blood glucose, especially if not done during the seizure. check regularly blood glucose if necessary. rapid diagnostic test for malaria in endemic areas csf examination (lumbar puncture) and culture white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and creatinine, liver enzymes and coagulation tests, blood culture note if patient does not return to baseline status within 30 to 60 minutes of end of seizure. frequent causes of seizures febrile seizures: in young children with fever, usually in a context of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. cns infections: e.g. any meningitis (for bacterial meningitis, see chapter 7); severe malaria, neurocysticercosis, trypanosomiasis (see chapter 6); cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis (see hiv infection and aids, chapter 8). metabolic abnormalities: e.g. hypoglycaemia (chapter 1), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia, hypocalcaemia). intoxications: e.g. psychoactive drugs and alcohol, methanol, medications, neurotoxic pesticides and venoms, carbon monoxide. page 26 / 409withdrawal from cns depressants: e.g. alcohol (see agitation and acute confusional state, chapter 11), opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates. use of seizure-provoking drugs: many drugs may be involved, e.g. antidepressants, antipsychotics, some antimicrobials. vitamin b deficiencies (thiamine and pyridoxine), particularly in patients with chronic alcohol consumption. epilepsy: undiagnosed epilepsy, poor adherence to treatment, ineffective treatment or abrupt stop of asm. head trauma, cns tumour, stroke, sepsis, encephalopathy (e.g. hypertensive, hypoxic). dosage of second-line antiseizure medications table 3 -

hypoglycaemia is an abnormally low concentration of blood glucose. severe hypoglycaemia can be fatal or lead to irreversible neurological damage. blood glucose levels should be measured whenever possible in patients presenting symptoms of hypoglycaemia. if hypoglycaemia is suspected but blood glucose measurement is not available, glucose (or another available sugar) should be given empirically. always consider hypoglycaemia in patients presenting impaired consciousness (lethargy, coma) or seizures. for diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycaemia in neonates, refer to the guide essential obstetric and newborn care, msf. clinical features rapid onset of non-specific signs, mild to severe depending on the degree of the hypoglycaemia: sensation of hunger and fatigue, tremors, tachycardia, pallor, sweats, anxiety, blurred vision, difficulty speaking, confusion, convulsions, lethargy, coma. diagnosis capillary blood glucose concentration (reagent strip test): non-diabetic patients: hypoglycaemia: < 3.3 mmol/litre (< 60 mg/dl) severe hypoglycaemia: < 2.2 mmol/litre (< 40 mg/dl) diabetic patients on home treatment: < 3.9 mmol/litre (< 70 mg/dl) [1] if blood glucose measurement is not available, diagnosis is confirmed when symptoms resolve after the administration of sugar or glucose. symptomatic treatment conscious patients: children: a teaspoon of powdered sugar in a few ml of water or 50 ml of fruit juice, maternal or therapeutic milk or 10 ml/kg of 10% glucose by oral route or nasogastric tube. adults: 15 to 20 g of sugar (3 or 4 cubes) or sugar water, fruit juice, soda, etc. symptoms improve approximately 15 minutes after taking sugar by oral route. patients with impaired consciousness or prolonged convulsions: children: 2 ml/kg of 10% glucose by slow iv (2 to 3 minutes) a adults: 1 ml/kg of 50% glucose by slow iv (3 to 5 minutes) neurological symptoms improve a few minutes after the injection. check blood glucose after 15 minutes. if it is still low, re-administer glucose by iv route or sugar by oral route according to the patient’s clinical condition. if there is no clinical improvement, differential diagnoses should be considered: e.g. serious infection (severe malaria, meningitis, etc.), epilepsy, unintentional alcohol intoxication or adrenal insufficiency in children. in all cases, after stabilisation, give a meal or snack rich in complex carbohydrates and monitor the patients for a few hours. page 32 / 409if patient does not return to full alertness after an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, monitor blood glucose levels regularly. aetiological treatment other than diabetes: treat severe acute malnutrition, neonatal sepsis, severe malaria, acute alcohol intoxication, etc. end prolonged fast. replace drugs inducing hypoglycaemia (e.g. quinine iv, pentamidine, ciprofloxacin, enalapril, beta-blockers, high- dose aspirin, tramadol), or anticipate hypoglycaemia (e.g. administer quinine iv in a glucose infusion). in diabetic patients: avoid missing meals, increase intake of carbohydrates if necessary. adjust dosage of insulin according to blood glucose levels and physical activity. adjust dosage of oral antidiabetics, taking into account possible drug interactions. footnotes (a) if ready-made 10% glucose solution is not available: remove 100 ml of 5% glucose from a 500 ml bottle or bag, then add 50 ml of 50% glucose to the remaining 400 ml of 5% glucose to obtain 450 ml of 10% glucose solution. references 1. american diabetes association. standards of care in diabetes—2023 abridged for

each patient depending on cultural background, age, etc. it is a subjective experience meaning that only the individual is able to assess his/her level of pain. regular assessment of the intensity of pain is indispensable in establishing effective treatment. clinical features pain assessment intensity: use a simple verbal scale in children over 5 years and adults, and nfcs or flacc scales in children less than 5 years (see pain evaluation scales). pattern: sudden, intermittent, chronic; at rest, at night, on movement, during care procedures, etc. character: burning, cramping, spasmodic, radiating, etc. aggravating or relieving factors, etc. clinical examination of the organ or area where the pain is located. specific signs of underlying disease (e.g. bone or osteoarticular pain may be caused by a vitamin c deficiency) and review of all systems. associated signs (fever, weight loss, etc.). synthesis the synthesis of information gathered during history taking and clinical examination allows aetiological diagnosis and orients treatment. it is important to distinguish: nociceptive pain: it presents most often as acute pain and the cause-effect relationship is usually obvious (e.g. acute post-operative pain, burns, trauma, renal colic, etc.). the pain may be present in different forms, but neurological exam is normal. treatment is relatively well standardized. neuropathic pain, due to a nerve lesion (section, stretching, ischaemia): most often chronic pain. on a background of constant, more or less localized pain, such as paraesthesia or burning, there are recurrent acute attacks such as electric shock-like pain, frequently associated with disordered sensation (anaesthesia, hypo or hyperaesthesia). this type of pain is linked to viral infections directly affecting the cns (herpes simplex, herpes zoster), neural compression by tumors, post- amputation pain, paraplegia, etc. mixed pain (cancer, hiv) for which management requires a broader approach. pain evaluation scales self-evaluation scale - children over 5 years and adults simple verbal scale (svs) intensity no mild moderate severe pain of pain pain pain pain scoring 0 1 2 3 write

treatment treatment depends on the type and intensity of the pain. it may be both aetiological and symptomatic if a treatable cause is identified. treatment is symptomatic only in other cases (no cause found, non-curable disease). page 39 / 409nociceptive pain the who classifies analgesics used for this type of pain on a three-step ladder: step 1: non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). step 2: weak opioid analgesics such as codeine and tramadol. their combination with one or two step 1 analgesics is recommended. step 3: strong opioid analgesics, first and foremost morphine. their combination with one or two step 1 analgesics is recommended. the treatment of pain is based on a few fundamental concepts: pain can only be treated correctly if it is correctly evaluated. the only person who can evaluate the intensity of pain is the patient himself. the use of pain assessment scales is invaluable. the pain evaluation observations should be recorded in the patient chart in the same fashion as other vital signs. treatment of pain should be as prompt as possible. it is recommended to administer analgesics in advance when appropriate (e.g. before painful care procedures). analgesics should be prescribed and administered at fixed time intervals (not on demand). oral forms should be used whenever possible. the combination of different analgesic drugs (multimodal analgesia) is advantageous. start with an analgesic from the level presumed most effective: e.g., in the event of a fractured femur, start with a step 3 analgesic. the treatment and dose chosen are guided by the assessment of pain intensity, but also by the patient’s response which may vary significantly from one person to another. treatment of

an effective treatment for many types of severe pain. its analgesic effect is dosedependent. its adverse effects have often been exaggerated and should not be an obstacle to its use. the most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression, which may be fatal. this adverse effect results from overdose. it is, therefore, important to increase doses gradually. respiratory depression is preceded by drowsiness, which is a warning to monitor respiratory rate (rr). the rr should remain equal to or greater than the thresholds indicated below: children 1 to 12 months rr ≥ 25 respirations/minute children 1 to 2 years rr ≥ 20 respirations/minute children 2 to 5 years rr ≥ 15 respirations/minute children > 5 years and adults rr ≥ 10 respirations/minute respiratory depression must be identified and treated quickly: verbal and physical stimulation of the patient; administration of oxygen; respiratory support (bag and mask) if necessary. if no improvement, administer naloxone (antagonist of morphine) in bolus to be repeated every minute until rr normalises and the excessive drowsiness resolves: 5 micrograms/kg in children and 1 to 3 micrograms/kg in adults. morphine and codeine always cause constipation. a laxative should be prescribed if the opioid treatment continues more than 48 hours. lactulose po is the drug of choice: children < 1 year: 5 ml daily; children 1-6 years: 5 to 10 ml daily; children 7-14 years: 10 to 15 ml daily; adults: 15 to 45 ml daily. page 42 / 409if the patient’s stools are soft, a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl po: children > 3 years: 5 to 10 mg once daily; adults: 10 to 15 mg once daily) is preferred. nausea and vomiting are common at the beginning of treatment. children: ondansetron po: 0.15 mg/kg (max. 4 mg per dose) up to 3 times daily do not use metoclopramide in children. adults: haloperidol po (2 mg/ml oral solution): 1 to 2 mg up to 6 times daily or metoclopramide po: 5 to 10 mg 3 times daily with an interval of at least 6 hours between each dose do not combine haloperidol and metoclopramide. for chronic pain in late stage disease (cancer, aids etc.), morphine po is the drug of choice. it may be necessary to increase doses over time according to pain assessment. do not hesitate to give sufficient and effective doses. morphine, tramadol and codeine have similar modes of action and should not be combined. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine must not be combined with morphine, pethidine, tramadol or codeine because they have competitive action. treatment of nociceptive pain in pregnant and

409commonly used analgesics are often ineffective in treating this type of pain. treatment of neuropathic pain is based on a combination of two centrally acting drugs: amitriptyline po adults: 25 mg once daily at bedtime (week 1); 50 mg once daily at bedtime (week 2); 75 mg once daily at bedtime (as of week 3); max.150 mg daily. reduce the dose by half in elderly patients. carbamazepine po adults: 200 mg once daily at bedtime (week 1); 200 mg 2 times daily (week 2); 200 mg 3 times daily (as of week 3) given its teratogenic risk, carbamazepine should only be used in women of childbearing age when covered by effective contraception (intrauterine device or injectable progestogen). it is not recommended in pregnant women. mixed pain in mixed pain with a significant component of nociceptive pain, such as in cancer or aids, morphine is combined with antidepressants and antiepileptics. chronic pain in contrast to acute pain, medical treatment alone is not always sufficient in controlling chronic pain. a multidisciplinary approach including medical treatment, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and nursing is often necessary to allow good pain relief and encourage patient selfmanagement. co-analgesics the combination of certain drugs may be useful or even essential in the treatment of pain: antispasmodics, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, corticosteroids, local anaesthesia, etc. page 44 / 409anaemia last updated: january 2024 anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (hb) level below reference values [1] [2] , which vary depending on age, sex, and pregnancy status (see table 2). anaemia may be caused by: decreased production of red blood cells: iron deficiency, nutritional deficiencies (folic acid, vitamin b , vitamin a), 12 depressed bone marrow function, certain infections (hiv, visceral leishmaniasis), renal failure; loss of red blood cells: acute or chronic haemorrhage (gastrointestinal ulcer, ancylostomiasis, schistosomiasis, etc.); increased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis): parasitic (malaria), bacterial and viral (hiv) infections; haemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease, thalassaemia); intolerance to certain drugs (primaquine, dapsone, co- trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, etc.) in patients with g6pd deficiency. the causes of anaemia are often interlinked. clinical features common signs: pallor of the conjunctivae, mucous membranes, palms of hands and soles of feet; fatigue, dizziness, dyspnoea, tachycardia, heart murmur. signs of decompensation: cold extremities, altered mental status, oedema in the lower limbs, respiratory distress, elevated jugular venous pressure, cardiac/coronary failure, shock. significant signs: cheilosis and glossitis (nutritional deficiency), jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dark coloured urine (haemolysis), bleeding (maelena, haematuria, etc.), signs of malaria (chapter 6), etc. laboratory hb levels rapid diagnostic test or thick and thin blood films in areas where malaria is endemic. urinary dipstick: check for haemoglobinuria or haematuria. if sickle cell disease is suspected (to be done before blood transfusion): rapid diagnostic test (sickle scan®) or, if not available, emmel test. full blood count (fbc) if available to guide diagnosis. table 1 - possible diagnoses with fbc page 45 / 409characteristics main diagnoses macrocytic deficiency (folic acid,

in the event of associated iron deficiency, wait 4 weeks after malaria treatment before prescribing iron supplements. suspected haemolytic anaemia: stop any drug that causes haemolysis in patients with (or that may possibly have) g6pd deficiency. blood transfusion indications to decide whether to transfuse, several parameters should be taken into account: clinical tolerance of anaemia underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, infection, etc.) rate at which anaemia develops. hb levels if transfusion is indicated, it should be carried out without delay b . for transfusion thresholds, see table 2. volume to be transfused if presence of haemorrhagic shock: see shock, chapter 1. otherwise: children [3] : transfusion volume is based on presence or absence of fever at any point from the time of ordering blood to the time of transfusion: if no fever (axillary temperature ≤ 37.5 °c) c : administer either 15 ml/kg of packed red blood cells (prbc) over 3 hours or 30 ml/kg of whole blood over 4 hours if fever (axillary temperature > 37.5 °c) c : administer either 10 ml/kg of prbc over 3 hours or 20 ml/kg of whole blood over 4 hours adolescents and adults: start with an adult unit of prbc or whole blood; do not exceed a transfusion rate of 5 ml/kg/hour. repeat if necessary, depending on clinical condition. monitoring monitor the patient’s condition and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature): during the transfusion: 5 minutes after the start of transfusion, then every 15 minutes during the first hour, then every 30 minutes until the end of the transfusion. after the transfusion: 4 to 6 hours after the end of the transfusion. pay attention to signs of transfusion reaction, fluid overload, decompensation or continuing blood loss. for children: measure hb once between 8 and 24 hours after the end of the transfusion or if signs of decompensation or continuing blood loss. if signs of circulatory overload appear: stop temporarily the transfusion. sit the patient in an upright position. administer oxygen. administer furosemide by slow iv injection: children: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg adults: 20 to 40 mg repeat the injection (same dose) after 2 hours if necessary. once the patient has been stabilised, start the transfusion again after 30 minutes. page 47 / 409prevention iron (and folic acid) deficiency: drug supplements:

page 54 / 409severe acute malnutrition last updated: february 2024 severe acute malnutrition (sam) results from insufficient energy (kilocalories), fat, protein and/or other nutrients (vitamins and minerals, etc.) to cover individual needs. sam is frequently associated with medical complications due to metabolic disturbances and compromised immunity. it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children globally. the protocols below are focused on the diagnosis and management of sam in children 6 to 59 months only. for further details regarding this age group, and guidance for other age groups, refer to national recommendations and/or specialised protocols. clinical assessment characteristic physical signs in marasmus: skeletal appearance resulting from significant loss of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat. in kwashiorkor: bilateral oedema of the lower limbs sometimes extending to other parts of the body (e.g. arms and hands, face). discoloured, brittle hair; shiny skin which may crack, weep, and become infected. diagnostic and admission criteria diagnostic criteria for sam are both anthropometric and clinical: mid-upper arm circumference (muac) a measures the degree of muscle wasting. muac < 115 mm indicates sam and significant mortality risk. weight-for-height z-score (whz) indicates the degree of weight loss by comparing the weight of the child with the median weight of non-malnourished children of the same height and sex. sam is defined as whz < –3 with reference to the who child growth standards b . the presence of bilateral pitting oedema of the lower limbs (when other causes of oedema have been ruled out) indicates sam, regardless of muac and whz. admission criteria for sam treatment programmes vary with context. refer to national recommendations. medical complications children with any of the following severe medical conditions should receive hospital-based medical management: pitting oedema extending from the lower limbs up to the face; anorexia (observed during appetite test); other severe complications: persistent vomiting, shock, altered mental status, seizures, severe anaemia (clinically suspected or confirmed), persistent hypoglycaemia, eye lesions due to vitamin a deficiency, frequent or abundant diarrhoea, dysentery, dehydration, severe malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, severe cutaneous infection, fever of unknown origin, etc. in the absence of these conditions, children should be treated as outpatients with regular follow-up. nutritional treatment all children with sam should receive nutritional treatment. page 55 / 409nutritional treatment is based on the use of specialised nutritious foods enriched with vitamins and minerals: f-75 and f-100 therapeutic milks, and ready-to-use therapeutic food (rutf). nutritional treatment is organised into phases: phase 1 (inpatient) intends to restore metabolic functions and treat or stabilize medical complications. children receive f-75 therapeutic milk. this phase may last 1 to 7 days, after which children usually enter transition phase. children with medical complications generally begin with phase 1. transition phase (inpatient) intends to ensure tolerance of increased food intake and continued improvement of clinical condition. children receive f-100 therapeutic milk and/or rutf. this phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days, after which children enter phase 2. phase 2 (outpatient or inpatient) intends to promote rapid weight gain and catch-up growth. children receive rutf. this phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days when inpatient, after which children are discharged for outpatient care. children without medical complications enter directly into this phase as outpatients. the outpatient component usually lasts several weeks. breastfeeding should be continued in breastfed children. drinking water should be given in addition to meals, especially if the ambient temperature is high, or the child has a fever or is receiving rutf. routine medical management the following should be provided to all inpatients and outpatients with sam: antibiotic from d1, unless specific signs of infection are present: treatment amoxicillin po: 50 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily for 5 to 7 days malaria on d1, rapid diagnostic test in endemic areas and treatment for malaria according to results or if testing is not available (see malaria, chapter 6). intestinal in transition phase or upon outpatient admission, albendazole po: parasites children 12 to 23 months: 200 mg single dose children 24 months and over: 400 mg single dose vaccination in transition phase or upon outpatient admission, measles vaccine for children 6 months to 5 years, unless a document shows that the child received 2 doses of vaccine administered as follows: one dose at or after 9 months and one dose at least 4 weeks after the first dose. children vaccinated between 6 and 8 months should be re-vaccinated as above (i.e. with 2 doses) once they reach 9 months of age, provided that an interval of 4 weeks from the first dose is respected. other vaccines included in the epi: check vaccination status and refer the child to vaccination services at discharge. tuberculosis at d1 then regularly during treatment, screen for tb. for a child screening positive, perform (tb) complete diagnostic evaluation. for more information, refer to the guide tuberculosis, msf. hiv infection perform hiv counselling and testing (unless the mother explicitly declines testing). children under 18 months: test the mother with rapid diagnostic tests. for a mother testing positive, request pcr test for the child. children 18 months and over: test the child with rapid diagnostic tests. page 56 / 409management of complications infections respiratory, cutaneous and urinary infections are common. however, classic signs of infection, such as fever, may be absent [1] . severe infection or sepsis should be suspected in children that are lethargic or apathetic or suffering from an acute complication such as hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, seizures, difficulty breathing, or shock. immediately administer ampicillin iv 50 mg/kg every 8 hours + gentamicin iv 7.5 mg/kg once daily. continue this treatment unless the source of infection is identified and different antibiotic treatment is required. if circulatory impairment or shock, immediately administer ceftriaxone iv, one dose of 80 mg/kg, then assess the source of infection to determine further antibiotic treatment. see also shock, chapter 1. transfuse urgently as for severe anaemia (see below) if haemoglobin (hb) is < 6 g/dl. in less severe infections, assess the source of infection (see fever, chapter 1) and treat accordingly. if fever is present and causes discomfort, undress the child. if insufficient, administer paracetamol po in low dose: 10 mg/kg, up to 3 times maximum per 24 hours. encourage oral fluids (including breast milk). if hypothermia is present, place the child skin-to-skin against the mother's body and cover with a warm blanket. treat for infection as above. check blood glucose level and treat for hypoglycaemia if necessary (see hypoglycaemia, chapter 1). in children with kwashiorkor, infection of cutaneous lesions is common and may progress to soft tissue or systemic infection. if cutaneous infection is present, stop amoxicillin and start amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po. use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. the dose is expressed in amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days. severe anaemia children with hb < 4 or < 6 with signs of decompensation (such as respiratory distress) or ongoing blood loss require transfusion within the first 24 hours. see anaemia (chapter 1) for volume to be transfused and patient monitoring during and after transfusion. preferably use packed red blood cells (prbc), if available. monitor closely for signs of fluid overload (see box below). diarrhoea and dehydration diarrhoea is common. therapeutic foods facilitate the recovery of physiological function of the gastrointestinal tract. amoxicillin administered as part of routine treatment reduces intestinal bacterial overgrowth. diarrhoea generally resolves without additional treatment. if an aetiological treatment is necessary, see acute diarrhoea, chapter 3. zinc supplementation is not needed if children consume recommended amounts of therapeutic foods. the diagnosis of dehydration is based on history and clinical features. clinical assessment is difficult in children with sam as delayed skin pinch test and sunken eyes are often present even in the absence of dehydration. for classification of degree of dehydration adapted for children with sam, see table below: page 57 / 409clinical features no some severe (2 or more of the following signs) dehydration dehydration dehydration lethargic or mental status normal restless, irritability unconscious no thirst, drinks unable to drink or drinks thirst thirsty, drinks eagerly normally poorly absent for urine output normal reduced several hours recent frequent watery yes yes yes diarrhoea and/or vomiting recent obvious rapid weight no yes yes loss acute diarrhoea with no dehydration (plan a sam) stools are neither frequent nor abundant (outpatient): oral rehydration solution (ors) po: 5 ml/kg after each loose stool to prevent dehydration. stools are frequent and/or abundant (inpatient): resomal c po or by nasogastric tube (ngt): 5 ml/kg after each loose stool to prevent dehydration. in all cases, continue feeding and breastfeeding, encourage oral fluids. acute diarrhoea with some dehydration (plan b sam) determine the target weight (weight before the onset of diarrhoea) before starting rehydration. if not feasible (e.g. new admission), estimate target weight as current weight x 1.06. resomal c po or by ngt: 20 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. in addition, administer 5 ml/kg of resomal after each loose stool if tolerated. assess after 2 hours (clinical evaluation and weight): if improvement (diarrhoea and signs of dehydration regress): reduce resomal to 10 ml/kg/hour until the signs of dehydration and/or weight loss (known or estimated) have been corrected. assess every 2 hours. once there are no signs of dehydration and/or the target weight is reached, change to plan a sam to prevent dehydration. if no improvement after 2 to 4 hours or if oral rehydration cannot compensate for losses: change to plan c sam "with circulatory impairment". continue feeding including breastfeeding. monitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below). regardless of the target weight, stop rehydration if signs of fluid overload appear. acute diarrhoea with severe dehydration (plan c sam) in all patients: assess for circulatory impairment (see shock, chapter 1). estimate target weight as current weight x 1.1. page 58 / 409measure blood glucose level and treat hypoglycaemia (chapter 1) if necessary. monitor vital signs and signs of dehydration every 15 to 30 minutes. monitor urine output. monitor for signs of fluid overload (see box below). if there is no circulatory impairment: resomal po or by ngt: 20 ml/kg over 1 hour if the child is alert, continue feeding including breastfeeding. assess after 1 hour: if improvement: change to plan b sam, but keep the same target weight. if rehydration po/ngt not tolerated (e. g. vomiting): stop resomal. administer glucose 5%-ringer lactate (g5%-rl) d iv infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. assess after 2 hours of iv fluids: if improvement and/or not vomiting, stop g5%-rl iv infusion and change to plan b sam. if no improvement or still vomiting, continue g5%-rl iv infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. if deterioration with circulatory impairment: see below. if there is circulatory impairment: administer ceftriaxone iv, one dose of 80 mg/kg. subsequent antibiotic treatment depends on assessment of underlying cause. administer g5%-rl iv infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour for 2 hours. stop resomal if the child was taking it. assess after 1 hour of iv fluids: if improvement and no vomiting: stop iv fluid and change to plan b sam, but keep the same target weight. if no improvement: continue g5%-rl iv infusion: 10 ml/kg/hour. prepare for blood transfusion. assess after 2 hours of iv fluids: if improvement: change to plan b sam, but keep the same target weight. if no improvement or deterioration: check hb as baseline and administer blood transfusion using a separate iv line. see anaemia (chapter 1) for volume to be transfused and patient monitoring during and after transfusion. while transfusing, continue g5%-rl iv infusion 10 ml/kg/hour for another 2 hours. signs of fluid overload include: rr ≥ 10 breaths/minute compared to initial rr, or hr ≥ 20 beats/minute compared to initial hr plus any one of the following: new or worsening hypoxia (decrease in spo by > 5%) 2 new onset of rales and/or fine crackles in lung fields new galloping heart rhythm increased liver size (must have marked liver border with pen before rehydration) new peripheral or eyelid oedema other complications for other complications (to be treated as inpatient), see: hypoglycaemia, seizures, chapter 1. acute pneumonia, chapter 2. stomatitis, chapter 3. xerophthalmia (vitamin a deficiency), chapter 5. page 59 / 409discharge criteria in general: children can be discharged from hospital and be treated as outpatients if the following criteria are met: clinically well; medical complications controlled; able to eat rutf (observed during appetite test); reduction or absence of oedema; caregiver feels able to provide care as outpatient; vaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised. children can be discharged from nutritional treatment if the following criteria are met: co-existing medical conditions stable and outpatient treatment organised if necessary (e.g. dressing changes, follow-up for chronic diseases); vaccinations up to date or referral to vaccination service organised; absence of oedema and whz > –2 or muac > 125 mm for at least 2 weeks. discharge criteria vary with context. refer to national recommendations. footnotes (a) muac is measured at the mid-point of the left upper arm. the arm should be relaxed. the measuring tape should be in contact with the skin all around the arm, without exerting pressure.

monitor spo , except in mild obstruction. 2 administer oxygen continuously: to maintain the spo between 94 and 98% if it is ≤ 90% a or if the patient has cyanosis or respiratory distress; 2 if pulse oxymeter is not available: at least 5 litres/minute or to relieve the hypoxia and improve respiration. hospitalize (except if obstruction is mild), in intensive care if danger signs. monitor mental status, heart and respiratory rate, spo and severity of obstruction. 2 maintain adequate hydration by mouth if possible, by iv if patient unable to drink. page 62 / 409management of foreign body aspiration acute airway obstruction (the foreign body either completely obstructs the pharynx or acts as a valve on the laryngeal inlet), no warning signs, most frequently in a child 6 months-5 years playing with a small object or eating. conscience is initially maintained. perform maneuvers to relieve obstruction only if the patient cannot speak or cough or emit any sound: children over 1 year and adults: heimlich manoeuvre: stand behind the patient. place a closed fist in the pit of the stomach, above the navel and below the ribs. place the other hand over fist and press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust. perform one to five abdominal thrusts in order to compress the lungs from the below and dislodge the foreign body. children under 1 year: place the infant face down across the forearm (resting the forearm on the leg) and support the infant’s head with the hand. with the heel of the other hand, perform one to five slaps on the back, between shoulder plates. if unsuccessful, turn the infant on their back. perform five forceful sternal compressions as in cardiopulmonary resuscitation: use 2 or 3 fingers in the center of the chest just below the nipples. press down approximately one- third the depth of the chest (about 3 to 4 cm). repeat until the foreign body is expelled and the patient resumes spontaneous breathing (coughing, crying, talking). if the patient loses consciousness ventilate and perform cardiopulmonary rescucitation. tracheostomy if unable to ventilate. differential diagnosis and management of airway obstructions of infectious

and rhinopharyngitis (common cold) rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucosa) and rhinopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa) are generally benign, self-limited and most often of viral origin. however, they may be an early sign of another infection (e.g. measles or influenza) or may be complicated by a bacterial infection (e.g. otitis media or sinusitis). clinical features nasal discharge or obstruction, which may be accompanied by sore throat, fever, cough, lacrimation, and diarrhoea in infants. purulent nasal discharge is not indicative of a secondary bacterial infection. in children under 5 years, routinely check the tympanic membranes to look for an associated otitis media. treatment antibiotherapy is not recommended: it does not promote recovery nor prevent complications. treatment is symptomatic: clear the nose with 0.9% sodium chloride a . fever, throat soreness: paracetamol po for 2 to 3 days (fever, chapter 1). footnotes (a) for a child: place him on his back, head turned to the side, and instil 0.9% sodium chloride into each nostril. page 65 / 409acute sinusitis acute sinusitis is an inflammation of one or more of the sinus cavities, caused by an infection or allergy. most acute sinus infections are viral and resolve spontaneously in less than 10 days. treatment is symptomatic. acute bacterial sinusitis may be a primary infection, a complication of viral sinusitis or of dental origin. the principal causative organisms are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is essential to distinguish between bacterial sinusitis and common rhinopharyngitis (see rhinitis and rhinopharyngitis). antibiotic therapy is required in case of bacterial sinusitis only. without treatment, severe sinusitis in children may cause serious complications due to the spread of infection to the neighbouring bony structures, orbits or the meninges. clinical features sinusitis in adults purulent unilateral or bilateral discharge, nasal obstruction and facial unilateral or bilateral pain that increases when bending over; painful pressure in maxillary area or behind the forehead. fever is usually mild or absent. sinusitis is likely if symptoms persist for longer than 10 to 14 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days or are severe (severe pain, high fever, deterioration of the general condition). sinusitis in children same symptoms; in addition, irritability or lethargy or cough or vomiting may be present. in the event of severe infection: deterioration of the general condition, fever over 39 °c, periorbital or facial oedema. treatment symptomatic treatment fever and pain (chapter 1). clear the nose with 0.9% sodium chloride a . antibiotherapy in adults: antibiotherapy is indicated if the patient meets the criteria of duration or severity of symptoms. oral amoxicillin is the first-line treatment. if the diagnosis is uncertain (moderate symptoms < 10 days) and the patient can be reexamined in the next few days, start with a symptomatic treatment, as for rhinopharyngitis or viral sinusitis. in children: antibiotic therapy is indicated if the child has severe symptoms or mild symptoms associated with risk factors (e.g. immunosuppression, sickle cell disease, asthma). oral amoxicillin is the first-line treatment. amoxicillin po for 7 to 10 days: page 66 / 409children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily) adults: 1 g 3 times daily in the event of failure to respond within 48 hours of therapy: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po for 7 to 10 days. use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively. the dose is expressed in amoxicillin: children < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily children ≥ 40 kg and adults: ratio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily) ratio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily) in penicillin-allergic patients: erythromycin po for 7 to 10 days: children: 30 to 50 mg/kg daily b adults: 1 g 2 to 3 times daily in infants with ethmoiditis, see periorbital and orbital cellulitis (chapter 5). other treatments for sinusitis secondary to dental infection: dental extraction while under antibiotic treatment. in the event of ophthalmologic complications (ophthalmoplegia, mydriasis, reduced visual acuity, corneal anesthesia), refer for surgical drainage. footnotes (a) for a child: place him on his back,

(b) for dosage according to age or weight, see erythromycin in the guide essential drugs, msf. page 67 / 409acute pharyngitis last updated: november 2020 acute inflammation of the tonsils and pharynx. the majority of cases are of viral origin and do not require antibiotic treatment. group a streptococcus (gas) is the main bacterial cause, and mainly affects children aged 3 to 14 years. acute rheumatic fever (arf), a serious late complication of gas pharyngitis, can be prevented with antibiotic treatment. one of the main objectives of assessing acute pharyngitis is to identify patients requiring antibiotic treatment. clinical features features common to all types of pharyngitis: throat pain, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), inflammation of the tonsils and pharynx, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, with or without fever. specific features, depending on the cause: common forms: erythematous (red throat) or exudative (red throat and whitish exudate) pharyngitis: this appearance is common to both viral and gas pharyngitis. centor criteria help assessment and decrease the empirical use of antibiotics in settings where rapid testing for gas is not available. a centor score of less than 2 rules out gas infection [1] [2] . nevertheless, in patients with risk factors (immunosuppression, personal or family history of arf) for poststreptococcal complications, or for local or general complications, do not use centor score and prescribe empirical antibiotic treatment. centor criteria criteria score temperature > 38 °c 1 absence of cough 1 tender anterior cervical lymph node(s) 1 tonsillar swelling or exudate 1 in patients over 14 years, the probability of gas pharyngitis is low. infectious mononucleosis (im) due to the epstein-barr virus should be suspected in adolescents and young adults with extreme fatigue, generalized adenopathy and often splenomegaly. erythematous or exudative pharyngitis may also be associated with gonococcal or primary hiv infection. in these cases, the diagnosis is mainly prompted by the patient's history. pseudomembranous pharyngitis (red tonsils/pharynx covered with an adherent greyish white false membrane): see diphtheria, chapter 2. vesicular pharyngitis (clusters of tiny blisters or ulcers on the tonsils): always viral (coxsackie virus or primary herpetic infection). ulcero-necrotic pharyngitis: hard and painless syphilitic chancre of the tonsil; tonsillar ulcer soft on palpation in a patient with poor oral hygiene and malodorous breath (vincent tonsillitis). other forms of pharyngitis: page 68 / 409spots on oral mucosa (koplik’s spots) accompanied by conjunctivitis and skin rash (see measles, chapter 8). “strawberry” (red and bumpy) tongue accompanied by a skin rash: scarlet fever caused by gas. local complications: peritonsillar, retropharyngeal or lateral pharyngeal abscess: fever, intense pain, dysphagia, hoarse voice, trismus (limitation of mouth opening), unilateral deviation of the uvula. general complications: complications due to the toxin: diphtheria (see diphtheria, chapter 2). poststreptococcal complications: arf, acute glomerulonephritis. signs of serious illness in children: severe dehydration, severe difficulty swallowing, upper airway compromise, deterioration of general condition. differential diagnosis: epiglottitis (see epiglottitis, chapter 2). treatment symptomatic treatment (fever and pain): paracetamol or ibuprofen po (fever, chapter 1). centor score ≤ 1: viral pharyngitis, which typically resolves within a few days (or weeks, for im): no antibiotic treatment. centor score ≥ 2 or scarlet fever: antibiotic treatment for gas infections [3] : if single-use injection equipment is available, benzathine benzylpenicillin is the drug of choice as streptococcus a resistance to penicillin remains rare; it is the only antibiotic proven effective in reducing the incidence of rheumatic fever; and the treatment is administered as a single dose. benzathine benzylpenicillin im children under 30 kg (or under 10 years): 600 000 iu single dose children 30 kg and over (or 10 years and over) and adults: 1.2 miu single dose penicillin v is the oral reference treatment, but poor adherence is predictable due to the length of treatment. phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin v) po for 10 days children 1 to < 6 years: 250 mg 2 times daily children 6 to < 12 years: 500 mg 2 times daily children 12 years and over and adults: 1 g 2 times daily children under 1 year: 125 mg 2 times daily amoxicillin is an alternative and the treatment has the advantage of being relatively short. however, it can cause adverse skin reactions in patients with undiagnosed im and thus should be avoided when im has not been excluded amoxicillin po for 6 days children: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily adults: 1 g 2 times daily macrolides should be reserved for penicillin allergic patients as resistance to macrolides is frequent and their efficacy in the prevention of rheumatic fever has not been studied. azithromycin po for 3 days children: 20 mg/kg once daily (max. 500 mg daily) adults: 500 mg once daily gonococcal or syphilitic pharyngitis: as for genital gonorrhoea (chapter 9) and syphilis (chapter 9). diphtherial pharyngitis: see diphtheria (chapter 2). vincent tonsillitis: metronidazole or amoxicillin. peritonsillar retropharyngeal or lateral pharyngeal abscess: refer for surgical drainage. page 69 / 409if signs of serious illness or epiglottitis are present in children: hospitalise. references 1. fine am, nizet v, mandl kd. large-scale validation of the centor and mcisaac scores to predict group a streptococcal pharyngitis. arch intern med. 2012;172(11):847-852. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3627733/ [accessed 20 october 2020] 2. national institute for health and care excellence. sore throat (acute): antimicrobial prescribing. 2018. http://www.nice.org.uk/ng84 [accessed 20 october 2020] 3. group a streptococcal disease, centers for disease control and prevention. atlanta (ga): cdc;

dysphagia and cervical adenitis, at times progressing to massive swelling of the neck; airway obstruction and possible suffocation when the infection extends to the nasal passages, larynx, trachea and bronchi; fever is generally low-grade [2] . generalised signs due to effects of the toxin: cardiac dysfunction (tachycardia, arrhythmias), severe myocarditis with heart failure and possibly cardiogenic shock (see shock, chapter 1) 3 to 7 days or 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease; neuropathies in 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of disease leading to nasal voice and difficulty with swallowing (paralysis of the soft palate), vision (ocular motor paralysis), breathing (paralysis of respiratory muscles) and ambulation (limb paralysis); oliguria, anuria and acute renal failure. differential diagnoses: epiglottitis and acute pharyngitis, chapter 2, stomatitis, chapter 3. laboratory diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of toxigenic c. diphtheriae by culture (and antibiotic susceptibility test) of swab specimens collected from the affected areas: throat (tonsils, pharyngeal mucosa, soft palate, exudate, ulcer, etc.), nasopharynx. the presence of the toxin is confirmed by pcr testing (detection of diphtheria toxin gene). treatment isolation of patients;

(aom) chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) page 80 / 409acute otitis externa diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, due to bacterial or fungal infection. common precipitants of otitis externa are maceration, trauma of the ear canal or presence of a foreign body or dermatologic diseases (such as eczema, psoriasis). clinical features ear canal pruritus or ear pain, often severe and exacerbated by motion of the pinna; feeling of fullness in the ear; clear or purulent ear discharge or no discharge otoscopy (remove skin debris and secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry cotton wool): diffuse erythema and edema, or infected eczema, of the ear canal look for a foreign body if visible, the tympanic membrane is normal (swelling and pain very often prevent adequate visualization of the tympanic membrane) treatment remove a foreign body, if present. treatment of pain: paracetamol po (chapter 1, pain). local treatment: remove secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry cotton wool). consider ear irrigation (0.9% sodium chloride, using a syringe) only if the tympanic membrane can be fully visualised and is intact (no perforation). otherwise, ear irrigation is contra-indicated. apply ciprofloxacin ear drops in the affected ear(s) for 7 days: children ≥ 1 year: 3 drops 2 times daily adults: 4 drops 2 times daily page 81 / 409acute otitis media (aom) acute inflammation of the middle ear, due to viral or bacterial infection, very common in children under 3 years, but uncommon in adults. the principal causative organisms of bacterial otitis media are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and in older children, streptococcus pyogenes. clinical features rapid onset of ear pain (in infants: crying, irritability, sleeplessness, reluctance to nurse) and ear discharge (otorrhoea) or fever. other signs such as rhinorrhoea, cough, diarrhoea or vomiting are frequently associated, and may confuse the diagnosis, hence the necessity of examining the tympanic membranes. otoscopy: bright red tympanic membrane (or yellowish if rupture is imminent) and presence of pus, either externalised (drainage in ear canal if the tympanic membrane is ruptured) or internalised (opaque or bulging tympanic membrane). the combination of these signs with ear pain or fever confirms the diagnosis of aom. note: the following otoscopic findings are not sufficient to make the diagnosis of aom: a red tympanic membrane alone, with no evidence of bulging or perforation, is suggestive of viral otitis in a context of upper respiratory tract infection, or may be due to prolonged crying in children or high fever. the presence of air bubbles or fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane, in the absence of signs and symptoms of acute infection, is suggestive of otitis media with effusion (ome). complications, particularly in high-risk children (malnutrition, immunodeficiency, ear malformation) include chronic suppurative otitis media, and rarely, mastoiditis, brain abscess or meningitis. treatment in all cases: treatment of fever and pain: paracetamol po (chapter 1). ear irrigation is contra-indicated if the tympanic membrane is ruptured, or when the tympanic membrane cannot be fully visualised. ear drops are not indicated. indications for antibiotic therapy: antibiotics are prescribed in children less than 2 years, children whose assessment suggests severe infection (vomiting, fever > 39 °c, severe pain) and children at risk of unfavourable outcome (malnutrition, immunodeficiency, ear malformation). for other children: if the child can be re-examined within 48 to 72 hours: it is preferable to delay antibiotic prescription. spontaneous resolution is probable and a short symptomatic treatment of fever and pain may be sufficient. antibiotics are prescribed if there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms after 48 to 72 hours. if the child cannot be re-examined: antibiotics are prescribed. for children treated with antibiotics: advise the mother to bring the child back if fever and pain persist after 48 hours. choice of antibiotherapy: amoxicillin is the first-line treatment: amoxicillin po for 5 days children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily) adults: 1 g 3 times daily page 82 / 409amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used as second-line treatment, in the case of treatment failure. treatment failure is defined as persistence of fever and/or ear pain after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) po for 5 days use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. the dose is expressed in amoxicillin: children < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily children ≥ 40 kg and adult: ratio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily) ratio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily) persistence of a ear drainage alone, without fever and pain, in a child who has otherwise improved (reduction in systemic symptoms and local inflammation) does not warrant a change in antibiotic therapy. clean ear canal by gentle dry mopping until no more drainage is obtained. macrolides should be reserved for very rare penicillin-allergic patients, as treatment failure (resistance to macrolides) is frequent. azithromycin po children over 6 months: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days page 83 / 409chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) chronic bacterial infection of the middle ear with persistent purulent discharge through a perforated tympanic membrane. the principal causative organisms are pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, staphylococcus, other gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. clinical features purulent discharge for more than 2 weeks, often associated with hearing loss or even deafness; absence of pain and fever otoscopy: perforation of the tympanic membrane and purulent exudate complications: consider a superinfection (aom) in the case of new onset of fever with ear pain, and treat accordingly. consider mastoiditis in the case of new onset of high fever, severe ear pain and/or tender swelling behind the ear, in a patient who appears significantly unwell. consider brain abscess or meningitis in the case of impaired consciousness, neck stiffness and focal neurological signs (e.g. facial nerve paralysis). treatment remove secretions from the auditory canal by gentle dry mopping (use a dry cotton bud or a small piece of dry cotton wool). apply ciprofloxacin ear drops until no more drainage is obtained (approximately 2 weeks, max. 4 weeks): children 1 year and over: 3 drops 2 times daily adults: 4 drops 2 times daily complications: chronic mastoiditis is a medical emergency that requires prompt hospitalisation, prolonged antibiotherapy that covers the causative organisms of csom (ceftriaxone im for 10 days + ciprofloxacin po for 14 days), atraumatic cleaning of the ear canal; surgical treatment may be required. before transfer to hospital, if the patient needs to be transferred, administer the first dose of antibiotics. meningitis (chapter 7). page 84 / 409pertussis (whooping cough) last updated: december 2024 pertussis is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis. it is transmitted via airborne droplets spread by infected people (by coughing and/or sneezing), particularly within 3 weeks of the onset of cough [1] . despite the development of effective vaccines, it remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants. this disease is endemic worldwide and outbreaks are common. it most commonly affects children < 5 years, but can affect any age group. reported incidence in adolescents and adults has been increasing in some regions [2] . pertussis is a notifiable disease in many countries, and cases should be reported to local or national public health authorities. pertussis immunization is part of all vaccination schedules and is included in the expanded programme on immunization (epi). clinical features after an incubation period of 7 to 10 days (up to 21 days), the illness evolves in 3 stages [3] : catarrhal stage (1 to 2 weeks, but may be shorter in infants < 6 months): runny nose, mild cough, no or low-grade fever. during this stage, the disease is indistinguishable from other non-specific respiratory infections. paroxysmal stage (1 to 6 weeks): cough of increasing severity, occuring in characteristic bouts (paroxysms) of a series of coughs during one exhalation, followed by a laboured inspiration causing a distinctive gasping sound (whoop), and/or post-tussive vomiting. no or low-grade fever. apnoea and cyanosis (in infants). prolonged cough, sometimes without paroxysms or whoop (particularly in older children and adults). complications may include secondary bacterial pneumonia (new-onset fever can be an indicator), dehydration and malnutrition triggered by feeding difficulty due to cough and vomiting, seizures, encephalopathy, sudden death, intracranial bleeding, petechiae, rib fracture, hernia, rectal prolapse. convalescent stage (weeks to months): paroxysms of cough gradually decrease in frequency and severity. the disease is most severe, with a high risk of death, in infants. adolescents and adults commonly have milder symptoms, but older adults, immunocompromised persons, and people with underlying respiratory conditions are at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation [4] . pertussis is most contagious and antibiotic treatment is most beneficial during the catarrhal stage of the illness. since this is also the period during which clinical symptoms and signs are non-specific, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion with clues from the context. these include patients with any compatible symptoms and close contact with a suspected case or in a pertussis outbreak setting. management suspected cases antibiotic treatment page 85 / 409antibiotic treatment is indicated for the following patients [5] and should be started as soon as pertussis is suspected: all patients 1 year of age and older, within 3 weeks of the onset of cough. infants and pregnant women, within 6 weeks of the onset of cough. first line azithromycin po children < 6 months: 10 mg/kg once daily for 5 days children ≥ 6 months: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) on d1 then 5 mg/kg (max. 250 mg) once daily from d2 to d5 adults: 500 mg on d1 then 250 mg once daily from d2 to d5 alternatives erythromycin po (a) children: 15 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 days adults: 1 g 3 times daily co-trimoxazole po (b) children ≥ 6 weeks: 20 mg smx/4 mg tmp/kg (max. 800 mg smx/160 for 14 days mg tmp) 2 times daily adults: 800 mg smx/160 mg tmp 2 times daily (a) erythromycin is an alternative, but azithromycin is better tolerated and simpler to administer (shorter treatment duration, fewer daily doses). (b) use co-trimoxazole only if macrolides are contra-indicated, not tolerated, or not available. avoid: - during the first trimester of pregnancy (risk of congenital malformations), - after 36 weeks of pregnancy and in women breastfeeding neonates (0 to 4 weeks), or breastfeeding infants that are premature, low birth weight, jaundiced, or ill (risk of haemolysis and jaundice in the child). advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if there are signs of anaemia or jaundice, especially in regions with high prevalence of g6pd deficiency. admit the following patients to hospital patients with severe illness (e.g. respiratory distress, apnoea, cyanosis, pneumonia, seizures or impaired consciousness) infants up to 3 months of age (with monitoring 24 hours per day due to the risk of apnoea) patients with difficulty in feeding or drinking infection prevention and control measures patients with pertussis are considered infectious until they have completed 5 days of appropriate antibiotics, or if not treated, until 21 days after the start of the paroxysmal cough [1] . during this infectious period, these measures should be followed: in hospital: single room if possible, or grouping pertussis cases together away from other patients (cohorting); standard precautions and droplet precautions (including, for the patient, cough etiquette and wearing a surgical mask if outside the room) [6] all patients: avoid contact with young children and pregnant women; avoid congregate settings including childcare, school, and work page 86 / 409supportive care hydration and nutrition: if child is breastfeeding, continue; ensure adequate fluid and calorie intake, give frequent small feedings including after coughing bouts and post-tussive vomiting; some patients may require nasogastric tube feeding or iv maintenance fluids; be aware that ng tube placement might provoke paroxysmal coughing, so it should be inserted by experienced medical staff with minimal manipulation. if weight loss occurred during illness, consider food supplements for several weeks during convalescent stage when child is able to eat comfortably. respiratory measures place the patient in a semi-reclining position (± 30°). in case of apnoea, stimulate the patient, but be prepared to ventilate if necessary (keep bag and mask accessible). administer oxygen if spo < 92%, for severe respiratory distress, or for recurrent apnoea. perform gentle 2 oropharyngeal suctioning if required but avoid deep suctioning (may provoke paroxysmal coughing). for children treated as outpatients, teach the parents about signs that require immediate medical attention (e.g. respiratory difficulty, apnoea, cyanosis, increasing fever, seizures or impaired consciousness, dehydration, feeding difficulty). contacts post-exposure prophylaxis (same antibiotic treatment as for suspect cases) is recommended, regardless of vaccination status, for: asymptomatic close contacts (having face-to-face exposure or direct contact with oral, nasal, or other respiratory secretions [7] ) of a person with suspected pertussis within 3 weeks of onset of paroxysmal cough asymptomatic exposed people at high risk of complications or who will come into contact with people at high risk [4] [8] : pregnant women in the third trimester (risk to neonate), infants under 1 year, people with immunodepression, moderate to severe asthma, and consider for people with other underlying respiratory conditions and adults ≥ 65 years. isolation of asymptomatic contacts is not necessary. symptomatic contacts should be treated as suspected pertussis. assess whether the person is up-to-date with pertussis vaccination according to national protocol (see prevention). prevention pertussis vaccination provides substantial immunity that wanes over time [1] . in all cases (suspected cases and contacts) who are not up-to-date with pertussis vaccination, begin or refer for vaccination. routine vaccination with a 3-dose primary series of polyvalent vaccine containing pertussis antigen(s) from the age of 6 weeks or according to national protocol. a booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year of life [1] . based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be required later in life to reinforce immunity and reduce the risk of developing pertussis. if the pertussis primary vaccination series has been interrupted, it should be completed rather than restarted from the beginning. in general, vaccinations are deferred for patients with moderate to severe illness, but the vaccine should be administered as soon as the patient's condition has improved. vaccination will probably not prevent disease in a person who is already infected by b. pertussis. it is not a

acute inflammation of the bronchial mucosa, most commonly of viral origin. in older children it can be caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae. in children over 2 years of age with repetitive acute bronchitis or ‘wheezing’ bronchitis, consider asthma (see asthma). in children under 2 years of age, consider bronchiolitis (see bronchiolitis). clinical features often begins with a rhinopharyngitis that descends progressively: pharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheitis. heavy cough, dry at the beginning then becoming productive low-grade fever no tachypnoea, no dyspnoea on pulmonary auscultation: bronchial wheezing treatment fever: paracetamol po (chapter 1). keep the patient hydrated, humidify air (with a bowl of water or a wet towel). children: nasal irrigation with 0.9% sodium chloride or ringer lactate, 4 to 6 times daily to clear the airway. antibiotherapy is not useful for patients in good overall condition with rhinopharyngitis or influenza. antibiotherapy is indicated only if: the patient is in poor general condition: malnutrition, measles, rickets, severe anaemia, cardiac disease, elderly patient etc. if the patient has dyspnoea, fever greater than 38.5 °c and purulent expectorations: a secondary infection with haemophilus influenzae or with pneumococcus is probable. amoxicillin po children: 30 mg/kg 3 times daily (max. 3 g daily) for 5 days adults: 1 g 3 times daily for 5 days page 90 / 409chronic bronchitis a chronic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa due to irritation (tobacco, pollution), allergy (asthma) or infection (repetitive acute bronchitis). it may develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. clinical features productive cough for 3 consecutive months per year for 2 successive years. no dyspnoea at onset. dyspnoea develops after several years, first on exertion, then becoming persistent. on pulmonary auscultation: bronchial wheeze (always exclude tuberculosis). a patient with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis presents with: onset or increase of dyspnoea. increased volume of sputum. purulent sputum. treatment antibiotic treatment is not useful in treating simple chronic bronchitis. antibiotic treatment may be useful, for patients in a poor general condition only, for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (see acute bronchitis). discourage smoking and other irritating factors. page 91 / 409bronchiolitis last updated: october 2023 bronchiolitis is an epidemic and seasonal viral infection of the lower respiratory tract in children less than 2 years of age, characterised by bronchiolar obstruction. respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is responsible for 70% of cases of bronchiolitis. transmission of rsv is direct, through inhalation of droplets (coughing, sneezing), and indirect, through contact with hands or materials contaminated by infected secretions. in the majority of cases, bronchiolitis is benign, resolves spontaneously (relapses are possible), and can be treated on an outpatient basis. severe cases may occur, which put the child at risk due to exhaustion or secondary bacterial infection. hospitalisation is necessary when signs/criteria of severity are present (10 to 20% of cases). clinical features tachypnoea, dyspnoea, wheezing, cough; profuse, frothy, obstructive secretions. on auscultation: prolonged expiration with diffuse, bilateral wheezes; sometimes diffuse fine, end-inspiratory crackles. rhinopharyngitis, with dry cough, precedes these features by 24 to 72 hours; fever is absent or moderate. signs of severity: significant deterioration in general condition, toxic appearance (pallor, greyish colouration) apnoea, cyanosis (check lips, buccal mucosa, fingernails) respiratory distress (nasal flaring, sternal and chest wall indrawing) anxiety and agitation (hypoxia), altered level of consciousness respiratory rate > 60/minute decreased signs of respiratory distress (exhaustion) and decline of respiratory rate (< 30/minute below the age of 1 year and < 20/minute below the age of 3 years). exercise caution in interpreting these signs as indicators of clinical improvement. spo persistently < 92% 2 sweats, tachycardia at rest and in the absence of fever silence on auscultation (severe bronchospasm) difficulty drinking or sucking (reduced tolerance for exertion) treatment treatment is symptomatic. obstructive signs and symptoms last for about 10 days; cough may persist for 2 weeks or longer. hospitalise children with one of the following criteria: presence of any sign of severity pre-existing pathology (cardiac or pulmonary disease, malnutrition, hiv infection, etc.) consider hospitalisation on a case-by-case basis in the following situations: associated acute pathology (viral gastro-enteritis, bacterial infection, etc.) age less than 3 months in all other cases, the child may be treated at home, provided the parents are taught how to carry out treatment, and what signs of severity should lead to re-consultation. page 92 / 409outpatient treatment nasal irrigation with 0.9% nacl before each feeding (demonstrate the technique to the mother) a . small, frequent feedings to reduce vomiting triggered by bouts of coughing. increased fluids if fever and/or significant secretions are present. treat fever (chapter 1). handle the patient the patient as little as possible and avoid unnecessary procedures. hospitalisation in all cases: place the infant in a semi-reclining position (± 30°). nasal irrigation, small, frequent feeds, treatment of fever: as for outpatient treatment. gentle oro-pharyngeal suction if needed. monitor fluid intake: normal requirements are 80 to 100 ml/kg/day + 20 to 25 ml/kg/day with high fever or very profuse secretions. according to symptoms: humidified nasal oxygen if respiratory distress or spo < 92%. 2 when there is vomiting or significant fatigue when sucking, fluid requirements may be administered by nasogastric tube (small volumes on a frequent basis) or the iv route, for the shortest possible time. avoid breastfeeding or oral feeds in children with severe tachypnoea, but do not prolong ng feeds (respiratory compromise) or iv infusions any longer than necessary. bronchodilator therapy is not indicated but a trial treatment may be given in case of severe respiratory distress (salbutamol metered-dose inhaler, 100 micrograms/puff: 2 to 3 puffs with spacer, repeated 2 times at an interval of 30 minutes). if inhaled salbutamol appears effective in relieving symptoms, the treatment is continued (2 to 3 puffs every 6 hours in the acute phase, then gradual reduction as recovery takes place). if the trial is ineffective, the treatment is discontinued. antibiotics are not indicated unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. prevention and control the risk of transmission of the virus is increased in hospital settings: children with bronchiolitis should be grouped together, away from other children (cohorting). as infection is most commonly transmitted by the hands, the most important prevention measure is hand-washing after any contact with patients, and objects or surfaces in contact with patients on which the virus may survive for several hours. in addition, staff should wear gowns, gloves and surgical masks when in contact with patients. footnotes (a) lie the child on his back, head turned to the side and instil 0.9% nacl into the nose, one nostril at a time. page 93 / 409acute pneumonia pneumonia in children under 5 years of age pneumonia in children over 5 years and adults persistent pneumonia acute pneumonia is a viral, bacterial (pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, atypical bacteria) or parasitic (pneumocystosis) infection of the pulmonary alveoli. page 94 / 409pneumonia in children under 5 years of age the most common causes are viruses, pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. clinical features cough or difficulty breathing fever often high (> 39 °c), but the child may present with low-grade fever or may have no fever (often a sign of serious illness) clinical examination must be done on a calm child in order to correctly count the respiratory rate and look for signs of severity. a child has tachypnoea (increased respiratory rate) if: rr ≥ 60 breaths/minute in children under 1 months rr ≥ 50 breaths/minute in children from 1 to 11 months rr ≥ 40 breaths/minute in children from 12 months to 5 years on pulmonary auscultation: dullness with diminished vesicular breath sounds, crepitations and sometimes bronchial breathing or normal pulmonary auscultation. signs of severity (severe pneumonia): chest indrawing: the inferior thoracic wall depresses on inspiration as the superior abdomen expands cyanosis (lips, oral mucosa, fingernails) or spo < 90% 2 nasal flaring altered consciousness (child is abnormally sleepy or difficult to wake) stridor (hoarse noise on inspiration) grunting (a short repetitive noise produced by a partial closure of the vocal cords) on expiration refusal to drink or feed children under 2 months severe malnutrition notes: in malnourished children, the rr thresholds should be decreased by 5 breaths/minute from those listed above. chest indrawing is significant if it is clearly visible and present at all times. if it is observed when a child is upset or feeding and is not visible when the child is resting, there is no chest indrawing. in children under 2 months of age, moderate chest indrawing is normal as the thoracic wall is flexible. if only the soft tissues between the ribs or above the clavicles depress, there is no chest indrawing. consider also: malaria in endemic areas, as it may also cause cough and tachypnoea. staphylococcal pneumonia in patients with empyema or painful abdominal swelling and diarrhoea. pneumocystosis in children with confirmed or suspected hiv infection (see hiv infection and aids, chapter 8). tuberculosis: in a child with cough, fever and poor weight gain and a history of close contact with a tuberculous patient a . for the diagnosis, refer to the msf handbook, tuberculosis. in the event of pneumonia complicated with empyema (pus in the pleural space). treatment severe pneumonia (inpatient treatment) page 95 / 409children under 2 months the first line treatment is the combination ampicillin slow iv (3 minutes) for 10 days +

most of these children do not develop asthma. page 10 3/ 409acute asthma (asthma attack) last updated: june 2023 asthma attack is a substantial worsening of asthma symptoms. the severity and duration of attacks are variable and unpredictable. assessment of the severity of asthma attack the severity of the asthma attack must be rapidly evaluated by the following clinical criteria. not all signs are necessarily present. assessment of severity in children over 2 years and adults [1] [2] [3] mild or moderate attack severe or life-threatening attack able to talk in sentences cannot complete sentences in one breath or too breathless to talk or feed mild or moderate increase of very high rr respiratory rate (rr) children 2-5 years: > 40/minute children > 5 years and adults: > 30/minute normal or mild increase of heart rate (hr) very high hr children 2-3 years: ≤ 180/minute children 2-3 years: > 180/minute children 4-5 years: ≤ 150/minute children 4-5 years: > 150/minute children > 5 years and adults: ≤ 120/minute children > 5 years and adults: > 120/minute spo ≥ 90% (≥ 92% for children 2-5 years) spo < 90% (< 92% for children 2-5 years) 2 2 and no criteria of severe or life-threatening attack signs of life-threatening attack: altered level of consciousness (drowsiness, confusion, coma) exhaustion silent chest cyanosis arrhythmia or hypotension in adults treatment reassure the patient. treatment and follow-up depend on the severity of the attack and the patient’s response: mild to moderate attack place the patient in a 1/2 sitting position. administer: page 10 4/ 409salbutamol metered-dose inhaler (mdi) 100 micrograms/puff: 2 to 10 puffs every 20 minutes during the first hour. in children, use a spacer a (use face mask in children under 3 years). single puffs should be given one at a time, let the child breathe 4 to 5 times from the spacer before repeating the procedure. a spacer can also be used in adults to increase effectiveness. prednisolone po: one dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) for children over 5 years and adults oxygen if spo < 94% b . 2 if the attack is completely resolved: observe the patient for 1 hour (4 hours if they live far from the health centre) then give outpatient treatment: salbutamol mdi for 24 to 48 hours (2 to 4 puffs every 4 to 6 hours depending on clinical evolution) and prednisolone po (same dose as above once daily) to complete 5 days of treatment. reassess after 1 to 2 days: address any identified risk factor, reassess need for salbutamol and long-term treatment. if the patient is already receiving long-term treatment, reevaluate the severity of the asthma (see chronic asthma), review compliance and correct use of medications and adjust treatment if necessary. if the attack is only partially resolved, continue with salbutamol mdi (2 to 10 puffs every 1 to 4 hours) until symptoms subside. for children up to 5 years, administer one dose of prednisolone po as above if symptoms recur within 3 to 4 hours. when the attack is completely resolved, proceed as above. if symptoms worsen or do not improve, treat as severe attack. severe attack hospitalise c ;

infection due to mycobacterium tuberculosis, spread from person to person through inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. after infection, m. tuberculosis multiplies slowly in the lungs and is usually eliminated spontaneously or lies dormant. only 10% of cases develop active tuberculosis. the risk of progressing to active tuberculosis is higher in immunocompromised patients. in certain countries, half of newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients are co-infected with hiv [1] . for more information on tuberculosis, refer to the guide tuberculosis, msf. clinical features prolonged cough (> 2 weeks) with or without sputum production and/or haemoptysis, prolonged fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, chest pain and fatigue. differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), lung cancer, pulmonary distomatosis (flukes, chapter 6) and melioidosis (southeast asia). in an endemic area, the diagnosis of tuberculosis is to be considered, in any patient consulting for respiratory symptoms for over 2 weeks who does not respond to non-specific antibacterial treatment. laboratory in the general population: xpert® mtb/rif test which simultaneously detects m. tuberculosis (mtb) in sputum and resistance to rifampicin (rif). if not available perform sputum smear microscopy [2] . if hiv co-infection suspected or diagnosed: xpert® mtb/rif test and point-of-care, urine lf-lam (lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay) [2] . treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, the standard treatment is a combination of four antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). the regimen is organised into 2 phases (initial phase and continuation phase) and lasts 6 months. if the strain is drug-resistant, the treatment is longer and different drug combinations are used. it takes significant investment to cure tuberculosis, both from the patient and the medical team. only uninterrupted treatment will lead to cure and prevent the development of resistance. it is essential that the patient understands the importance of treatment adherence and has access to correct case management until treatment is completed. prevention bcg vaccination in neonates: provides 59% protection against pulmonary tuberculosis [3] . infection control in healthcare settings: standard precautions and airborne precautions

oropharyngeal candidiasis oral herpes other infectious causes stomatitis from scurvy (vitamin c deficiency) other lesions resulting from a nutritional deficiency page 11 3/ 409acute diarrhoea acute diarrhoea is defined as at least 3 liquid stools per day for less than 2 weeks. there are 2 clinical types of acute diarrhoea: diarrhoea without blood, caused by viruses in 60% of cases (rotavirus, enterovirus), bacteria (vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, non typhi salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica) or parasites (giardiasis). diseases, such as malaria, acute otitis media, respiratory tract infections, etc. can be accompanied by this type of diarrhoea. diarrhoea with blood, caused by bacteria (shigella in 50% of cases, campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive or enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, salmonella) or parasites (intestinal amoebiasis). infectious diarrhoeas are transmitted by direct (dirty hands) or indirect (ingestion of contaminated water or food) contact. the high mortality rate from diarrhoeal diseases, even benign, is due to acute dehydration and malnutrition. this can be prevented by adequate rehydration and nutrition. clinical features first assess for signs of dehydration (see dehydration, chapter 1). then look for other signs: profuse watery diarrhoea (cholera, enterotoxigenic e. coli), repeated vomiting (cholera), fever (salmonellosis, viral diarrhoea), presence of red blood in stools: see also shigellosis and amoebiasis (chapter 3). in a patient over 5 years with severe and rapid onset of dehydration, suspect cholera. treatment general principles: prevent or treat dehydration: rehydration consists of prompt replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses as required, until the diarrhoea stops. administer zinc sulfate to children under 5 years. prevent malnutrition. do not systematically administer antimicrobials: only certain diarrhoeas require antibiotics (see antimicrobial treatment). do not administer anti-diarrhoeal drugs or antiemetics. treat the underlying condition if any (malaria, otitis, respiratory infection, etc.). prevention and treatment of dehydration see dehydration, chapter 1. adapted treatment protocols are recommended for children with malnutrition (see severe acute malnutrition, chapter 1). prevention of malnutrition continue unrestricted normal diet. in breastfed children, increase the frequency of feeds. breast milk does not replace ors. ors should be given between feeds. zinc supplementation page 11 4/ 409zinc sulfate is given in combination with oral rehydration solution in order to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea, as well as to prevent further occurrences in the 2 to 3 months after treatment: zinc sulfate po children under 6 months: 10 mg (½ tablet) once daily for 10 days children from 6 months to 5 years: 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily for 10 days place the half-tablet or full tablet in a teaspoon, add a bit of water to dissolve it, and give the entire spoonful to the child. antimicrobial treatment diarrhoea without blood most acute diarrhoeas are caused by viruses unresponsive to antimicrobials. antimicrobials can be beneficial in the event of cholera or giardiasis. cholera: the most important part of treatment is rehydration. in the absence of resistance (perform antibiotic- sensitivity testing at the beginning of an outbreak), antibiotic treatment shortens the duration of diarrhoea. see the guide management of a cholera epidemic, msf. giardiasis: see intestinal protozoan infections, chapter 6. diarrhoea with blood shigellosis is the most frequent cause of bloody diarrhoea (amoebiasis is much less common). if there is no laboratory diagnosis to confirm the presence of amoebae, first line treatment is for shigellosis (chapter 3). amoebiasis: antiparasitic treatment only if motile entamoeba histolytica amoebae are found in stools or if a correct shigellosis treatment has been ineffective (see amoebiasis, chapter 3). prevention breastfeeding reduces infant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea and the severity of diarrhoea episodes. when the child is weaned preparation and storage of food are associated with the risk of contamination by faecal micro-organisms: discourage bottle-feeding; food must be cooked well; milk or porridge must never be stored at room temperature. access to sufficient amounts of clean water and personal hygiene (washing hands with soap and water before food preparation and before eating, after defecation etc.) are effective methods of reducing the spread of diarrhoea. in countries with a high rotavirus diarrhoea fatality rate, the who recommends routine rotavirus vaccination in children between 6 weeks and 24 months of age [1] . references 1. weekly

flexneri, s. boydii. s. dysenteriae type 1 (sd1) is the only strain that causes large scale outbreaks. it has the highest case fatality rate (up to 10%). patients at risk of death are children under 5 years, malnourished patients, children after measles, adults over 50 years. clinical features diarrhoea with bright red blood visible in stool a , with or without fever abdominal and rectal pain frequent signs of serious illness: fever above 39 °c; severe dehydration; seizures, altered mental status complications (more frequent with sd1): febrile seizures (5 to 30% of children), rectal prolapse (3%), septicaemia, intestinal obstruction or perforation, moderate to severe haemolytic uraemic syndrome laboratory shigellosis in an epidemic context: confirm the causal agent (stool culture) and perform antibiotic sensitivity tests. perform monthly culture and sensitivity tests (antibiotic resistance can develop rapidly, sometimes during the course of an outbreak). treatment

stop treatment; encourage patients to avoid alcohol and tobacco use; omeprazole po: 20 mg once daily in the morning for 7 to 10 days. in severe or recurrent cases, dose can be increased to 40 mg once daily and the treatment can be prolonged for up to 8 weeks. if the patient has frequent recurrences unrelated to nsaid use, that require repeated treatment with antiulcer drugs: see eradication of helicobacter pylori. treatment of complicated ulcers perforation perforation should be considered in patients presenting with sudden onset intense epigastric pain, particularly if there is rigidity of the abdominal wall. the risk of peritonitis is increased if the perforation occurs on a full stomach. to start: place the patient on a strict fast (npo); insert a nasogastric tube and aspirate if possible; insert an intravenous line and hydrate (ringer lactate); treat acute pain (see pain, chapter 1); omeprazole iv infusion: 40 mg once daily over 20 to 30 minutes refer to a surgeon. if referral not possible, risk of mortality is high: continue conservative management including maintenance fluid (alternate 5% glucose and ringer lactate). start iv antibiotics (see shock, chapter 1). if after 3 days, the patient's clinical condition has improved, cautiously restart oral feeding, remove the nasogastric tube and start po treatment to eradicate helicobacter pylori (see eradication of helicobacter pylori). gastrointestinal bleeding passing of black stool (maelena) and/or vomiting blood (haematemesis). in 80% of cases the bleeding stops spontaneously. insert a nasogastric tube for aspiration and insert an iv line (16g). if the haemodynamic state is stable (pulse and blood pressure are normal): hydrate (ringer lactate), monitor, keep npo for 12 hours. if there is no active haemorrhage, restart oral feeding after 12 hours. gastric lavage with cold water is not essential, but may help evaluate persistence of bleeding. if the haemorrhage continues (haematemesis) and/or if the haemodynamic state deteriorates (pulse increases, bp drops): page 12 2/ 409intensive care and transfusion according to the severity of the bleeding (see haemorrhagic shock, chapter 1). emergency surgical intervention. eradication of helicobacter pylori most peptic ulcers are caused by helicobacter pylori infection. if a diagnosis of ulcer is probable, treatment to eradicate h. pylori should be considered if the patient has frequent attacks requiring repeated and/or prolonged treatments with antiulcer drugs over 8 weeks or in cases of complicated ulcers (perforation or gastrointestinal bleeding). infection should be confirmed with a test where possible. h. pylori resistance to antibiotics varies globally, follow national recommendations where available. if not, for information, administer a triple therapy for 7 days: omeprazole po 20 mg 2 times daily + clarithromycin po 500 mg 2 times daily + amoxicillin po 1 g 2 times daily a . in immunocompromised patients, consider mycobacterium avium complex (mac) infection or other nontuberculous mycobacterium (ntm) infection prior to starting a clarithromycin-containing triple therapy. if symptoms continue despite treatment, consider the differential diagnosis of gastric cancer. refer for investigations if possible. notes: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and nsaid (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.) are contra-indicated in patients suffering from or with a history of ulcers. omeprazole is as effective po as iv. footnotes (a) in penicillin-allergic patients, amoxicillin po can be substituted with metronidazole po 500 mg 2 times daily. page 12 3/ 409dyspepsia last updated: december 2020 clinical features epigastric pain or discomfort following meals, often accompanied by bloating, sensation of fullness and nausea. dyspepsia is most commonly functional. the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is based on clinical assessment after ruling out organic causes (gastro-oesophageal reflux, gastric and duodenal ulcers, drug-induced symptoms, gastric cancer). if possible, test for helicobacter pylori. treatment in adults: in case of patients who test positive for h. pylori, see eradication of helicobacter pylori [1] . omeprazole po (10 mg once daily) for 4 weeks may help even in h. pylori-negative patients [2] [3] . note: consider and treat possible intestinal parasites (see intestinal protozoan infections, cestodes, nematode infections, chapter 6;

observe their arrangement: isolated, clustered, linear, annular (in a ring). ask if the lesions are itchy. look for a possible cause: insect bites; scabies, lice, other parasitic skin infections; contact with plants, animals, jewellery, detergents, etc. ask about any past or ongoing treatment: topical, oral or parenteral. look for local or regional signs (secondary infection, lymphangitis, adenopathy, erysipelas) and/or systemic signs (fever, septicaemia, secondary focus). consider the sanitary conditions of the family, particularly for contagious skin diseases (scabies, scalp ringworm, lice). check tetanus vaccination status. patients with skin disease often present late. at this stage, primary lesions and specific signs may be masked by secondary infection. in these cases, it is necessary to re-examine the patient, after treating the secondary infection, in order to identify and treat the underlying skin disease. page 13 2/ 409scabies scabies is a cutaneous parasitosis due to the presence of the mite sarcoptes scabiei hominis within the epidermis. it exists in two forms: ordinary scabies, relatively benign and moderately contagious; and crusted scabies, favoured by immune deficiency, extremely contagious and refractory to conventional treatment. person to person transmission takes place chiefly through direct skin contact, and sometimes by indirect contact (sharing clothing, bedding). the challenge in management is that it must include simultaneous treatment of both the patient and close contacts, and at the same time, decontamination of clothing and bedding of all persons undergoing treatment, in order to break the transmission cycle. clinical features ordinary scabies in older children and adults itching, worse at night, very suggestive of scabies if close contacts have the same symptom and typical skin lesions: scabies burrows (common): fine wavy lines of 5 to 15 mm, corresponding to the tunnels made by the parasite within the skin. burrows are most often seen in the interdigital spaces of the hand and flexor aspect of the wrist, but may be present on the areolae, buttocks, elbows, axillae. the back and the face are spared. burrows may be associated with vesicles, corresponding to the entry point of the parasite in the skin. scabies nodules (less common): reddish-brown nodules, measuring 2 to 20 mm, on the genitals in men, persisting after effective treatment (they are not necessarily indicative of active infection). and/or secondary skin lesions: resulting from scratching (excoriations, crusts) or super-infection (impetigo). typical lesions and secondary lesions may co-exist, or specific lesions may be entirely masked by secondary lesions. in infants and young children vesicular eruption; often involving palms and soles, back, face, and limbs. secondary infection or eczematisation is frequent. isolated scabies nodules in the axillae may be the only manifestation. examination of the mother’s hands may support the diagnosis. crusted (norwegian) scabies thick, scaly, erythematous plaques, generalised or localised, resembling psoriasis, with or without itching (50% of cases). delay in diagnosis may lead to a scabies epidemic. treatment in all cases close contacts of the patient are treated simultaneously, even in the absence of symptoms. clothing and bedding (including that of contacts) are changed after each treatment. they are washed at ≥ 60 °c then dried in the sun, or exposed to sunlight for 72 hours, or sealed in a plastic bag for 72 hours. ordinary scabies page 13 3/ 409topical treatment topical scabicides are applied over the entire body (including the scalp, post-auricular areas, umbilicus, palms and soles), avoiding mucous membranes and face, and the breasts in breastfeeding women. particular attention should be paid to common infestation sites. the recommended contact time should not be shortened or exceeded; the patient must not wash his hands while the product is in use (or the product should be reapplied if the hands are washed). in children under 2 years, the hands must be wrapped to prevent accidental ingestion of the product and contact with eyes. topical scabicides should not be applied to broken or inflamed skin. treatment of secondary bacterial infection, if present, should be initiated 24 to 48 hours before use of topical scabicides (see impetigo). the preferred treatment is 5% permethrin cream: children 2 months and over and adults: one application, with a contact time of 8 hours, then rinse thoroughly. repeat the application after 7 days. or, if not available, 25% benzyl benzoate lotion: see the table below for dilution (depending on age), contact time and number of applications. children children children pregnant > 12 years < 2 years 2 to 12 years women and adults lotion must be lotion must be diluted before diluted before use: use: use undiluted use undiluted dilution 1 part 25% lotion + 1 part 25% 25% lotion 25% lotion 3 parts water lotion + 1 part water 12 hours (6 hours for infants 24 hours then 24 hours then 12 hours then contact time < 6 months) rinse thoroughly rinse thoroughly rinse thoroughly then rinse thoroughly two applications (e.g. 24 hours apart, with a rinse between the 2 applications; or 2 successive number of applications one application one application applications, 10 minutes apart, when the first application has dried with a rinse after 24 hours) oral treatment treatment with ivermectin po (200 micrograms/kg single dose) is an alternative: it is more practical than topical treatment (e.g. in the case of an epidemic or for treating contacts) and can be started right away in the case of secondary infection. a single dose may be sufficient; a second dose 7 days later reduces the risk of treatment failure. ivermectin is not recommended for children < 15 kg or pregnant women (safety not established) a . administration of ivermectin to patients with loiasis carries a risk of severe neurological complications when significant loa loa microfilaraemia is present (see filariasis, chapter 6) b . ivermectin po single dose: page 13 4/ 409weight 15 to 24 kg 25 to 35 kg 36 to 50 kg 51 to 65 kg ivermectin 3 mg tab 1 tab 2 tab 3 tab 4 tab treatment effectiveness is judged on clinical grounds. itching may persist for 1 to 3 weeks after elimination of the parasite. persistence of typical burrows beyond 4 weeks should lead to suspicion of treatment failure (insufficient treatment, e.g. the scalp was not included in topical treatment or the patient washed his hands during the treatment period), or early re-infestation (contacts and environment not treated). in these cases, patient and contacts should be retreated. persistent itching may be due to another condition, initially masked by scabies. crusted scabies treatment combines simultaneous administration of oral ivermectin and topical scabicide at regular intervals, e.g. every week for 2 to 3 weeks or more, according to severity and clinical response. crusts should be softened (salicylic acid ointment) and removed before applying local treatment (otherwise, local treatment is ineffective). as exfoliated skin scales may spread the parasite, the patient should be isolated during the treatment, staff should use protection (gloves, gowns and hand washing after contact), and environment (bedding, floors and surfaces) should be decontaminated. footnotes (a) treatment with ivermectin in these patients is reserved for severe cases for which no alternative exists (see crusted scabies). (b) in areas where loiasis is endemic, certain precautions are recommended before administering ivermectin: e.g. measure the loa loa microfilaraemia, if possible, or ensure that the patient has no history of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the conjunctiva or transient « calabar » swellings), nor history of severe adverse reactions following a previous treatment with ivermectin, or if in doubt, use topical treatment in preference to oral. page 13 5/ 409lice (pediculosis) pediculosis is a benign contagious parasitic infection due to 3 species of lice specific to humans: head lice, body lice and pubic lice. transmission from person to person occurs through direct or indirect contact. body lice are potential vectors of relapsing fever (chapter 7), typhus (eruptive rickettsioses, chapter 7) and trench fever. clinical features head lice mainly affect children: itching and scratch marks (nape of neck and around the ears), which may become secondarily infected (impetigo) in prolonged infestation; presence of live lice and/or live (shiny, grey) nits attached to the hair shaft within 5 mm of the scalp. body lice mainly affect populations living under poor conditions (refugees, prisoners, the homeless): itching and scratch marks (back, belt line and armpits), often inflamed and infected; presence of lice and nits in the clothing (parasites are not found on the body). pubic lice are considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (sti): itching and scratch marks (pubic and perianal area), but other hairy areas may also be affected (armpits, thighs, eyelashes); lice and nits at the base of the hair shaft, rarely visible. examine contacts; check for associated systemic infection (body lice) or sti (pubic lice). treatment head lice apply lotion to scalp and dry hair, paying particular attention to the areas behind the ears and around the nape of the neck. do not reduce or exceed the recommended duration of application. 4% dimeticone lotion children 6 months and over and adults: leave on hair for 8 hours, then rinse thoroughly. keep away from flames and/or intense heat sources (including cigarettes) during application and until rinsing (risk of ignition). or, if dimeticone is not available or in children 2 to 6 months: 1% permethrin lotion. children 2 months and over and adults: leave on hair for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. repeat application of either treatment after 7 days. decontaminate combs, headwear and bedding (wash ≥ 60 °c/30 minutes, iron or dry in the sun or, if not feasible, seal in a plastic bag for 2 weeks). treat as above contacts with live lice and/or live nits. do not treat those with dead nits alone (dull, white, > 1 cm from scalp). body lice mass treatment (outbreak) apply 30 to 60 g (2 to 4 heaped soup spoons) of 0.5% permethrin powder to the inside of the clothes and underclothes in contact with the skin (front and back, neck and waistline, sleeves and socks) in a fully clothed patient, then rub in the powder by hand. leave for 12 to 24 hours. treat other clothing (including headwear) and bedding in a plastic bag with 0.5% permethrin powder. repeat in 8 to 10 days if the infestation persists. page 13 6/ 409individual treatment disinfection of clothing and bedding as above or as for head lice. pubic lice shave and/or apply 1% permethrin lotion to hairy areas (as for head lice). treat the partner at the same time. decontaminate clothing and bedding (as for head lice). repeat the application after 7 days. treatment of secondary bacterial infection, if present, should begin 24 to 48 hours before local antiparasitic treatment (see impetigo); local treatment is applied later when tolerated. page 13 7/ 409superficial fungal infections superficial fungal infections are benign infections of the skin, scalp and nails caused by candida albicans or dermatophytes. clinical features and treatment candidiasis candidal diaper dermatitis erythema of the perianal area with peripheral desquamation and sometimes pustules. secondary infection may develop. buttocks must be kept clean (ordinary soap and water) and dry. avoid humidity: according to the context, expose the buttocks to air or change diapers more frequently; remove plastic pants. protect the skin with zinc oxide ointment if diarrhoea is present. if diaper dermatitis is severe and persistent despite these measures, consider an intestinal infection (nystatin po: 100 000 iu 4 times daily for 20 days). other candidiasis candidiasis of skin folds: miconazole 2% cream, one application 2 times daily for 2 to 4 weeks oral candidiasis: see stomatitis, chapter 3. vulvovaginal candidiasis: see abnormal vaginal discharge, chapter 9. dermatophytoses dermatophytes cause various clinical lesions, depending on the anatomic site involved: scalp, glabrous (hairless) skin, folds or nails. page 13 8/ 409anatomic clinical features treatment site (a) scalp common in children. depending on the species: • shave or cut hair short on and around scalp ringworm • one or more round, scaly, erythematous plaques with the lesions. tinea capitis the ends of broken hairs. • local treatment: 2 times daily, clean • inflammation, suppuration, crusting and peripheral with soap and water, dry and apply lymphadenopathy (kerion). miconazole 2% cream or whitfield’s • permanent hair loss (favus). ointment for 2 weeks or longer if some scalp ringworms are contagious: necessary. simultaneously examine (and treat) symptomatic • administer systemic treatment as contacts. local treatment alone does not cure scalp ringworm: griseofulvin po for 6 weeks minimum (up to 8 to 12 weeks) children 1 to 12 years: 10 to 20 mg/kg once daily (max. 500 mg daily) children ≥ 12 years and adults: 500 mg to 1 g once daily, depending on severity or itraconazole po children: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 4 to 6 weeks (max. 200 mg daily) adults: 200 mg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks • suppurative lesions: treat superinfection (see impetigo) before applying local antifungal treatment. • for painful kerion: paracetamol po. in pregnant lactating/breastfeeding women: oral antifungals are contraindicated. apply a topical treatment (miconazole 2% cream or whitfield’s ointment) to limit the spread of infection until it is possible to treat orally. glabrous skin erythematous, scaly, pruritic macule with a well- • for non widespread, localised tinea: ringworm of the demarcated, raised, vesicular border and central local treatment: 2 times daily, clean body healing. with soap and water, dry and apply tinea corporis miconazole 2% cream or whitfield’s ointment for 2 to 4 weeks or for 2 weeks after clinical resolution. • reserve oral antifungals for particularly extensive lesions: griseofulvin po for 4 to 6 weeks or itraconazole for 2 weeks. folds • interdigital spaces (tinea pedis): topical treatment as above. if oozing page 13 9/ 409tinea pedis pruritus, fissure and whitish scales in the 3rd and/or 4th lesions, use miconazole 2% cream (athlete’s foot) interdigital spaces (b) . only (do not use whitfield’s ointment). tinea cruris • groin (tinea cruris): circumscribed, pruritic, erythematous plaque, with a pale centre surrounded by vesiculo- pustules, extending outward from the groin.

[1] clinical features leprosy should be considered in any patient presenting with: hypopigmented or erythematous skin lesion(s) with partial or complete loss of sensation to touch, pain, heat; infiltrated pigmented nodules, initially with no sensory loss, on the face, ear lobes and the upper and lower limbs; tender, infiltrated and hypertrophied peripheral nerve (ulnar, radial, median, popliteal, tibial etc.) with possible paraesthesia of the extremities, trophic changes (perforating ulcer of the foot) or paralysis (steppage gait, deformaties of hands and feet, facial nerve paralysis). there are different clinical forms and classification systems of leprosy. ridley-jopling classification this classification differentiates 5 forms based on the bacteriological index. these forms correlate with the immunological response to m. leprae. patients with tuberculoid leprosy (tt) are resistant to the bacillus and infection is localised. patients with lepromatous leprosy (ll) are extremely sensitive to the bacillus and the infection is disseminated. borderline forms (bt, bb, bl) are between the two ends of the spectrum (tt and ll). paucibacillary forms multibacillary forms (least contagious forms) (most contagious forms) tuberculoid borderline borderline borderline lepromatous tuberculoid lepromatous t.t. b.t. b.b. b.l. l.l. who classification in order to simplify diagnosis and to promote rapid implementation of treatment, the who has simplified clinical classification of leprosy and differentiates only 2 forms: multibacillary leprosy: more than 5 skin lesions paucibacillary leprosy: 1 to 5 skin lesions multibacillary leprosy includes ll, bl and bb forms and paucibacillary leprosy includes the tt and bt forms of the ridley-jopling classification system. laboratory laboratory diagnosis is based on the detection of acid-fast bacilli in a ziehl-neelsen stained nasal smear and skin- split smear taken from the ear lobe or from a skin lesion. in tt leprosy bacilli are not found. in practice, in most endemic countries diagnosis is based on the who clinical classification (number of lesions). page 15 3/ 409treatment countries where leprosy is endemic have a control programme. check national recommendations. first-line treatment regimens recommended by the who multibacillary leprosy paucibacillary leprosy age (more than 5 skin lesions) (1 to 5 skin lesions) children 10 to 14 years rifampicin po: 450 mg once monthly rifampicin po: 450 mg once monthly + clofazimine po: 150 mg once monthly + clofazimine po: 150 mg once monthly and 50 mg on alternate days and 50 mg on alternate days + dapsone po: 50 mg once daily + dapsone po: 50 mg once daily children 15 years and rifampicin po: 600 mg once monthly rifampicin po: 600 mg once monthly over and adults + clofazimine po: 300 mg once monthly + clofazimine po: 300 mg once monthly and 50 mg once daily and 50 mg once daily + dapsone po: 100 mg once daily + dapsone po: 100 mg once daily duration 12 months 6 months note: the monthly doses of rifampicin and clofazimine are administered under direct observation by medical staff whereas the daily doses of clofazimine and dapsone are taken by the patient at home. rifampicin should be taken on an empty stomach to improve absorption. teach the patient to recognise and quickly report a lepra reaction or relapse in order to modify or restart treatment. leprosy reactions these reactions usually occur during the course of treatment in patients with multibacillary leprosy (bl and ll). they are associated with the immunological response to m. leprae antigens. urgent treatment is required to avoid irreversible disability. do not interrupt ongoing leprosy treatment. clinical features reversal reactions: exacerbation of the skin lesions that become erythematous and oedematous and risk or ulceration. onset or worsening of numbness of skin lesions; onset of acute painful hypertrophic neuritis. erythema nodosum leprosum: fever, asthenia, alteration of the general state; crops of purplish-red, tender subcutaneous nodules, warmer than the surrounding skin. treatment reversal reactions: prednisolone (or prednisone) po: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg once daily for 2 weeks. re-examine the patient every 2 weeks and decrease the dosage if the neurological signs recede. according to clinical response, treatment may last 3 to 6 months.

the invasive stage of a bacterial or parasitic infection (ascariasis, strongylodiasis, ancylostomiasis, schistosomiasis, loiasis), viral infection (hepatitis b or c); generalised disease (cancer, lupus, dysthyroidism, vasculitis). treatment if the pruritus is intense, antihistamines for a few days: loratadine po children over 2 years and under 30 kg: 5 mg (5 ml) once daily children over 30 kg and adults: 10 mg (1 tab) once daily in the event of anaphylactic reaction, see shock (chapter 1). page 16 2/ 409pellagra pellagra is a dermatitis resulting from niacin and/or tryptophane deficiency (in persons whose staple food is sorghum; patients with malabsorption, or during famine). clinical features classically, disease of the ‘three ds’: dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia. dark red plaques, well demarcated, symmetric, located on exposed areas of the body (forehead, neck, forearms, legs). the skin becomes very scaly, pigmented, sometimes with haemorrhagic bullae. gastrointestinal (glossitis, stomatitis and diarrhoea) and neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in more serious forms. treatment nicotinamide (vitamin pp) po [1] children and adults: 100 mg 3 times daily, give with a diet rich in protein until the patient is fully cured. in the event of an epidemic of pellagra, for example in a refugee camp, it is vital that the food ration be modified (add groundnuts or dry vegetables) in order to meet the daily requirements (approximately 15 mg daily for adults). references 1. world health organization, united nations high commissions for refugees. pellagra and its prevention and control in major emergencies. world health organization, 2000. http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/en/pellagra_prevention_control.pdf [accessed 23 may 2018] page 16 3/ 409chapter 5: eye diseases xerophthalmia (vitamin a deficiency) conjunctivitis neonatal conjunctivitis viral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis trachoma periorbital and orbital cellulitis other pathologies onchocerciasis (river blindness) loiasis pterygium cataract page 16 4/ 409xerophthalmia (vitamin a deficiency) the term xerophthalmia covers all the ocular manifestations of vitamin a deficiency. xerophthalmia can progress to irreversible blindness if left untreated. in endemic areas, vitamin a deficiency and xerophthalmia affect mainly children (particularly those suffering from malnutrition or measles) and pregnant women. disorders due to vitamin a deficiency can be prevented by the routine administration of retinol. clinical features the first sign is hemeralopia (crepuscular blindness): the child cannot see in dim light, may bump into objects and/or show decreased mobility. then, other signs appear gradually: conjunctival xerosis: bulbar conjunctiva appears dry, dull, thick, wrinkled and insensitive bitot’s spots: greyish foamy patches on the bulbar conjunctiva, usually in both eyes (specific sign, however not always present) corneal xerosis: cornea appears dry and dull corneal ulcerations keratomalacia (the last and most severe sign of xerophthalmia): softening of the cornea, followed by perforation of the eyeball and blindness (extreme care must be taken during ophthalmic examination due to risk of rupturing cornea) treatment treat early symptoms to avoid the development of severe complications. vision can be saved provided that ulcerations affect less than a third of the cornea and the pupil is spared. even if deficiency has already led to keratomalacia and irreversible loss of sight, it is imperative to administer treatment, in order to save the other eye and the life of the patient. retinol (vitamin a) po: treatment is the same regardless of the clinical stage, except in pregnant women. age 200 000 iu capsule (a) children < 6 months (b) 50 000 iu (2 drops) once daily on d1, d2 and d8 children 6 months to < 1 year 100 000 iu (4 drops) once daily on d1, d2 and d8 children ≥ 1 year and adults 200 000 iu (one capsule) once daily on d1, d2 and d8 (a) capsules must not be swallowed whole. cut the end of the capsule and deliver the dose directly into the mouth. (b) vitamin a deficiency is rare in breastfed infants under 6 months. in pregnant women, treatment varies according to the stage of illness: hemeralopia or bitot's spots: 10 000 iu once daily or 25 000 iu once weekly for at least 4 weeks. do not exceed indicated doses (risk of foetal malformations). page 16 5/ 409if the cornea is affected, risk of blindness outweighs teratogenic risk. administer 200 000 iu once daily on d1, d2 and d8. corneal lesions are a medical emergency. in addition to the immediate administration of retinol, treat or prevent secondary bacterial infections with 1% tetracycline eye ointment, one application 2 times daily (do not apply eye drops containing corticosteroids) and protect the eye with an eye-pad after each application. prevention systematically administer retinol po to children suffering from measles (one dose on d1 and d2). in areas where vitamin a deficiency is endemic a , routine supplementation of retinol po: age 200 000 iu capsule (c) children < 6 months 50 000 iu (2 drops) single dose children 6 months to < 1 year 100 000 iu (4 drops) every 4 to 6 months children 1 to < 5 years 200 000 iu (one capsule) every 4 to 6 months women after delivery 200 000 iu (one capsule) single dose (c) capsules must not be swallowed whole. cut the end of the capsule and deliver the dose directly into the mouth. to avoid excessive dosage, record any doses administered on the health/immunisation card and do not exceed indicated doses. vitamin a overdose may cause raised intracranial pressure (bulging fontanelle in infants; headache, nausea, vomiting) and, in severe cases, impaired consciousness and convulsions. these adverse effects are transient; they require medical surveillance and symptomatic treatment if needed. footnotes (a) for more information country-specific prevalence of vitamin a deficiency, see: https://www.thelancet.com/action/showpdf?pii=s2214-109x%2815%2900039-x page 16 6/ 409conjunctivitis neonatal conjunctivitis viral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis conjunctivitis is an acute inflammation of the conjunctiva due to a bacterial or viral infection, allergy, or irritation. conjunctivitis may be associated with measles or rhinopharyngitis in children. in the absence of hygiene and effective treatment, secondary bacterial infections may develop, affecting the cornea (keratitis). clinical features clinical signs of all conjuctivites include: redness of the eye and irritation. visual acuity is not affected. depending on the cause: abundant and purulent secretions, eyelids stuck together on waking, unilateral infection at onset: bacterial conjunctivitis; watery (serous) secretions, no itching: viral conjunctivitis; excessive lacrimation, eyelid oedema, intense itching: allergic conjunctivitis. in endemic areas, turn both upper eyelids up to check for signs of trachoma (see trachoma). suspect keratitis if patient reports intense pain (more than is usually associated with conjunctivitis) and photophobia. instill one drop of 0.5% fluorescein to check for possible ulcerations. always check for foreign bodies (subconjunctival or corneal) and remove after administering 0.4% oxybuprocaine anaesthetic eye drops. never give bottle of eye drops to the patient. treatment bacterial conjunctivitis clean eyes 4 times daily with boiled water or 0.9% sodium chloride. apply into both eyes 1% tetracycline eye ointment: one application 2 times daily for 7 days never use corticosteroid drops or ointment. viral conjunctivitis clean eyes 4 times daily with boiled water or 0.9% sodium chloride. apply local antibiotics if there is a (risk of) secondary bacterial infection (see above). allergic conjunctivitis local treatment as for viral conjunctivitis. antihistamines po for one to 3 days (see urticaria, chapter 4). note: in the event of a foreign body, check tetanus immunisation status. page 16 7/ 409neonatal conjunctivitis conjunctivitis due to neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or chlamydia trachomatis in neonates born to mothers with genital gonococcal and/or chlamydial infections at the time of delivery. neonatal conjunctivitis is a medical emergency. without prompt treatment, risk of corneal lesions and visual impairment. clinical features unilateral or bilateral purulent conjunctivitis in the first 28 days of life. treatment clean eyes with isotonic sterile solution (0.9% sodium chloride or ringer lactate) 4 times daily to remove secretions. antibiotic treatment: for all neonates with conjunctivitis in the first 28 days of life for all neonates born to mothers with a genital infection (purulent cervical discharge) at the time of delivery 0 to 7 days 8 to 28 days first line ceftriaxone im: 50 mg/kg single dose ceftriaxone im: 50 mg/kg single dose (max. 125 mg) (max. 125 mg) + azithromycin po: 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days alternatives if ceftriaxone contra-indicated: if azithromycin unavailable: cefotaxime im: 100 mg/kg single dose erythromycin po: 12.5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 14 days if symptoms persist 48 hours after parenteral treatment alone, administer azithromycin po (or erythromycin po as above). notes: when systemic treatment is not immediately available, clean both eyes and apply 1% tetracycline eye ointment every hour, until systemic treatment is available. in all cases, treat the genital infection of the mother and partner (see genital infections, chapter 9). azithromycin and erythromycin are associated with an increased risk of pyloric stenosis in neonates. the risk is higher with erythromycin [1] [2] [3] . adverse effects should be monitored. prevention apply as soon as possible and preferably within one hour after birth: 1% tetracycline eye ointment: application of 1 cm in each eye. references page 16 8/ 4091. lund m et al. use of macrolides in mother and child and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: nationwide cohort study. bmj. 2014;

the eyelashes rub against the cornea and cause ulcerations and chronic inflammation. stage 5: corneal opacity (co) cornea gradually loses its transparency, leading to visual impairment and blindness. treatment stages 1 and 2: clean eyes and face several times per day. antibiotic treatment [3] : the treatment of choice is azithromycin po: children: 20 mg/kg single dose adults: 1 g single dose failing the above, 1% tetracycline eye ointment: one application 2 times daily for 6 weeks, or, as a last resort, erythromycin po: 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily for 14 days. stage 3: no treatment stage 4: surgical treatment while waiting for surgery, if regular patient follow-up is possible, taping eyelashes to the eyelid is a palliative measure that can help protect the cornea. in certain cases, this may lead to permanent correction of the trichiasis within a few months. the method consists in sticking the ingrowing eyelashes to the external eyelid with a thin strip of sticking-plaster, making sure that the eyelid can open and close perfectly. replace the plaster when it starts to peel off (usually once a week); continue treatment for 3 months. page 17 1/ 409note: epilation of ingrowing eyelashes is not recommended since it offers only temporary relief and regrowing eyelashes are more abrasive to the cornea. stage 5: no treatment prevention cleaning of the eyes, face and hands with clean water reduces direct transmission and the development of secondary bacterial infections. references 1. solomon aw et al. the simplified trachoma grading system, amended. bull world health organ. 2020;98(10):698-705. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7652564/ [accessed 20 april 2021] 2. thylefors b et al. a simple system for the assessment of trachoma and its complications. bull world health organ. 1987;65(4):477–83. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2491032/ [accessed 20 april 2021] 3. evans jr et al. antibiotics for trachoma. cochrane database syst rev. 2019 sep 26;9:cd001860. https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.cd001860.pub4/full [accessed 20 april 2021] page 17 2/ 409periorbital and orbital cellulitis periorbital cellulitis is a common, usually benign, bacterial infection of the eyelids. it arises principally following trauma to the eyelids (insect bite or abrasion). orbital cellulitis is a serious infection involving the contents of the orbit (fat and ocular muscles) that may lead to loss of vision or a brain abscess. it usually arises secondary to spread from sinusitis (e.g. as a complication of ethmoid sinusitis). periorbital and orbital cellulitis are more common in children than in adults. the most common organisms causing periorbital and orbital cellulitis are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci, as well as haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) in children living in countries where rates of immunisation with hib remain low. clinical features signs common to both periorbital and orbital cellulitis: acute eyelid erythema and oedema; the oedema has a violaceous hue if secondary to h. influenzae. in case of orbital cellulitis only: pain with eye movements; ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of eye movements) often with diplopia (double vision);

in children: inability to sit or drink/suck. respiratory distress: rapid, laboured breathing or slow, deep breathing. shock: cold extremities, weak or absent pulse, capillary refill time ≥ 3 seconds, cyanosis. jaundice: yellow discolouration of mucosal surfaces of the mouth, conjunctivae and palms. haemoglobinuria: dark red urine. abnormal bleeding: skin (petechiae), conjunctivae, nose, gums; blood in stools. acute renal failure: oliguria (urine output < 12 ml/kg/day in children and < 400 ml/day in adults) despite adequate hydration. laboratory parasitological diagnosis [2] diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed, whenever possible. if testing is not available, treatment of suspected malaria should not be delayed. rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) a rapid tests detect parasite antigens. they give only a qualitative result (positive or negative) and may remain positive several days or weeks following elimination of parasites. page 18 1/ 409microscopy thin and thick blood films enable parasite detection, species identification, quantification and monitoring of parasitaemia. blood films may be negative due to sequestration of the parasitized erythrocytes in peripheral capillaries in severe malaria, as well as in placental vessels in pregnant women. note: even with positive diagnostic results, rule out other causes of fever. additional examinations haemoglobin (hb) level to be measured routinely in all patients with clinical anaemia, and in all patients with severe malaria. blood glucose level to be measured routinely to detect hypoglycaemia in patients with severe malaria and those with malnutrition (see hypoglycaemia, chapter 1). treatment of malaria due to p. vivax, p. ovale, p. malariae, p. knowlesi chloroquine (cq) po b children and adults: day 1: 10 mg base/kg day 2: 10 mg base/kg day 3: 5 mg base/kg in general p. vivax remains sensitive to cq but resistance is found in several countries. where such resistance is high (>10%), or in countries which have de-registered cq due to p. falciparum resistance, an artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) c should be used instead [1] . for dosing information, see treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. relapses can occur with p. vivax and p. ovale due to activation of dormant parasites in the liver. primaquine po for 14 days (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg once daily in children ≥ 15 kg; 15 mg once daily in adults) can be given to eliminate these parasites, after the initial treatment with cq or an act. however, this treatment is only recommended for patients living in areas where reinfection is unlikely, i.e. non-endemic, low transmission areas or in countries aiming for elimination of malaria. this treatment is contra-indicated in individuals with g6pd deficiency. if g6pd deficiency cannot be tested individually, the decision to prescribe primaquine must take into account the prevalence of deficiency in the population. treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria antimalarial treatment during pregnancy, see antimalarial treatment in pregnant women. treatment is an artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) c given by the oral route for 3 days [1] . the first-line act is chosen according to therapeutic efficacy in the area where the patient is living. if the first line act is unavailable, contra-indicated or has failed despite being correctly administered, use another act. for dosing information, see table below. page 18 2/ 409treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria b in low malaria endemic areas, in addition to act, all individuals (except in children < 30 kg, pregnant women or breastfeeding women of infants aged < 6 months) diagnosed with p. falciparum malaria, should be given a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine to reduce the risk of transmission [3] . notes: in infants below the age/weight mentioned in the table above, there is little data on efficacy and safety of acts. the combinations al, as/aq and dha/ppq can be used. the dose should be calculated so as to correspond to 10-16 mg/kg/dose of lumefantrine; 10 mg/kg daily of amodiaquine; 20 mg/kg daily of piperaquine. clinical condition of young children can deteriorate rapidly; it may be preferable to start parenteral treatment straight away (see below). quinine po is not recommended as standard treatment, however still remains in some national protocols: quinine po for 7 days b children and adults under 50 kg: 10 mg/kg 3 times daily adults 50 kg and over: 600 mg 3 times daily symptomatic treatment paracetamol po in the event of high fever only (fever, chapter 1). treatment of severe malaria the patient must be hospitalised. antimalarial treatment page 18 3/ 409during pregnancy, see antimalarial treatment in pregnant women. pre-referral treatment if the patient needs to be transferred, administer before transfer: at community level, for children under 6 years: one dose of rectal artesunate d (10 mg/kg) children 2 months to < 3 years (≤ 10 kg): 1 rectal capsule (100 mg) children 3 to < 6 years (≤ 20 kg): 2 rectal capsules (200 mg) or at dispensary level, for children and adults: the first dose of artesunate or, if unavailable, the first dose of artemether. for dosing information, see below. in either case, provide patients, especially children, with some sugar prior to or during transfer. inpatient treatment the drug of choice is artesunate, preferably iv, or if not possible im. for patients in shock: im route is not appropriate, use artesunate iv only. artesunate slow iv injection (3 to 5 minutes) or, if not possible, slow im injection, into the anterior thigh: children under 20 kg: 3 mg/kg/dose children 20 kg and over and adults: 2.4 mg/kg/dose one dose on admission (h0) one dose 12 hours after admission (h12) one dose 24 hours after admission (h24) then one dose once daily treat parenterally for at least 24 hours (3 doses), then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an act. if not, continue parenteral treatment once daily until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). if artesunate is not unavailable, artemether may be an alternative: artemether im into the anterior thigh (never administer by iv route) children and adults: 3.2 mg/kg on admission (d1) then 1.6 mg/kg once daily treat parenterally for at least 24 hours (2 doses), then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an act. if not, continue parenteral treatment once daily until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). note: if patient is still on parenteral treatment on day 5, continue on the same treatment until day 7. in this case it is not necessary to start an act. quinine iv is still recommended in some national protocols. it may be used in treatment of malaria with shock if artesunate iv is not available. the dose is expressed in quinine salt: loading dose: 20 mg/kg to be administered over 4 hours, then, keep the vein open with an infusion of 5% glucose over 4 hours; then maintenance dose: 8 hours after the start of the loading dose, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (alternate quinine over 4 hours and 5% glucose over 4 hours). for adults, administer each dose of quinine in 250 ml of glucose. for children under 20 kg, administer each dose of quinine in a volume of 10 ml/kg of glucose. do not administer a loading dose to patients who have received oral quinine, or mefloquine within the previous 24 hours: start with maintenance dose. treat parenterally for at least 24 hours, then, if the patient can tolerate the oral route, change to a complete 3-day course of an act (or if not available, oral quinine to complete 7 days of quinine treatment). if not, continue parenteral treatment until the patient can change to oral route (without exceeding 7 days of parenteral treatment). page 18 4/ 409symptomatic treatment and management of complications hydration maintain adequate hydration. as a guide, for volume to be administered per 24 hours by oral or iv route, see appendix 1. adjust the volume according to clinical condition in order to avoid dehydration or fluid overload (risk of pulmonary oedema). fever paracetamol in the event of high fever only (fever, chapter 1). severe anaemia for treatment, see anaemia, chapter 1. hypoglycaemia for treatment, see hypoglycaemia, chapter 1. notes: in an unconscious or prostrated patient, in case of emergency or when venous access is unavailable or awaited, use granulated sugar by the sublingual route to correct hypoglycaemia e . the risk of hypoglycaemia is higher in patients receiving iv quinine. coma check/ensure the airway is clear, measure blood glucose level and assess level of consciousness. in the event of hypoglycaemia or if blood glucose level cannot be measured, administer glucose. if the patient does not respond to administration of glucose, or if hypoglycaemia is not detected: insert a urinary catheter; place the patient in the recovery position. monitor vital signs, blood glucose level, level of consciousness, fluid balance (urine output and fluid input) hourly until stable, then every 4 hours. rule out meningitis (lumbar puncture) or proceed directly to administration of an antibiotic (see meningitis, chapter 7). reposition the patient every 2 hours; ensure eyes and mouth are kept clean and moist, etc. seizures see seizures, chapter 1. address possible causes (e.g. hypoglycaemia; fever in children). respiratory distress rapid laboured breathing: check for pulmonary oedema (crepitations on auscultation), which may occur with or without fluid overload: reduce iv infusion rate if the patient is receiving iv therapy, nurse semi-sitting, oxygen, furosemide iv: 1 mg/kg in children, 40 mg in adults. repeat after 1 to 2 hours if necessary. associated pneumonia should also be considered (see acute pneumonia, chapter 2). slow, deep breathing (suspected metabolic acidosis): look for dehydration (and correct if present), decompensated anaemia (and transfuse if present). oliguria and acute renal failure page 18 5/ 409look first for dehydration (dehydration, chapter 1), especially due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid losses (high fever, vomiting, diarrhoea). treat dehydration if present. be aware of the risk of fluid overload and acute pulmonary oedema. monitor for the return of urine output. acute renal failure (arf) is found almost exclusively in adults and is more common in asia than africa. insert a urinary catheter, measure output. restrict fluids to 1 litre/day (30 ml/kg/day in children), plus additional volume equal to urine output. renal dialysis is often necessary. antimalarial treatment in pregnant women uncomplicated p. vivax, p. ovale, p. malariae, p. knowlesi malaria as other patients. primaquine should not be given in pregnancy. uncomplicated falciparum malaria all act included in the table treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria can be used in all trimesters. if acts are not available, quinine po (for dosing, see treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria) combined with clindamycin po if possible (10 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days) may be an alternative to act. primaquine should not be given in pregnancy. severe malaria artesunate, or if unavailable artemether, is recommended in all trimesters. quinine iv is not recommended as standard treatment, however it still remains in some national protocols. prevention for pregnant women in areas with high risk of infection with p. falciparum, refer to the guide essential obstetric and newborn care, msf. in areas with seasonal malaria transmission (in particular across the sahel sub-region), seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children < 5 years reduces mortality: administer amodiaquine + sp at monthly intervals for 4 months during the transmission period [4] . in malaria endemic areas and in epidemic-prone contexts, all in-patient facilities (including hiv treatment centres and feeding centres), should be furnished with long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins). for more information, refer to the guide public health engineering, msf. see specialised literature for information regarding anti-vector measures and prevention in travellers. footnotes (a) most rapid tests detect the following antigens alone or in combination: hrp2 protein specific to p. falciparum; an enzyme (pf pldh) specific to p. falciparum; an enzyme (pan pldh) common to all 4 plasmodium species. hrp2 may continue to be detectable for 6 weeks or more after parasite clearance; pldh remains detectable for several days (up to 2 weeks) after parasite clearance. use pan pldh tests as first choice in hyper and holo-endemic areas, as well as in areas of intense seasonal transmission and during outbreaks or complex emergencies. in other contexts, hrp2 tests (p. falciparum > 95%) or hrp2 + pldh combination tests (p. falciparum < 95%) are preferred. (b) if the patient vomits within 30 minutes after administration: re-administer the full dose. if the patient vomits between 30 minutes and 1 hour after administration, re-administer half of the dose. if severe vomiting precludes oral therapy, manage as severe malaria, see treatment of severe malaria. page 18 6/ 409(c) act: a combination of artemisinin or one of its derivatives (e.g. artesunate, artemether) with another antimalarial of a different class. (d) if it is impossible to refer a patient to a center capable of providing parenteral treatment, rectal artesunate should be given according to the same schedule as artesunate slow iv injection (h0, h12, h24, then once daily). (e) place a level teaspoon of sugar, moistened with a few drops of water, under the tongue, then place the patient in the recovery position. repeat after 15 minutes if the patient has not regained consciousness. as with other methods for treating hypoglycaemia, maintain regular sugar intake, and monitor. references 1. world health organization. guidelines for the treatment of malaria, 3rd ed.

409human african trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) human african trypanosomiasis (hat) is a zoonosis caused by protozoa (trypanosomes), transmitted to humans through the bite of a tsetse fly (glossina). transmission by contaminated blood transfusion and transplacental transmission are also possible. the disease is found only in sub-saharan africa. there are two forms: trypanosoma brucei gambiense hat in western and central africa and trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense hat in eastern and southern africa. clinical features inoculation may be followed by an immediate local reaction (trypanosomal chancre). this chancre arises in about 50% of all rhodesiense but rarely in gambiense. gambiense hat incubation lasts from a few days to several years. the first stage (haemolymphatic stage) corresponds to the haematogenous and lymphatic dissemination of the parasite. signs include intermittent fever, joint pain, lymphadenopathy (firm, mobile, painless lymph nodes, mainly cervical), hepatosplenomegaly and skin signs (facial oedema, pruritus). the second stage (meningoencephalitic stage) corresponds to the invasion of the central nervous system. signs of the haemolymphatic stage recede or disappear and varying neurological signs progressively develop: sensory disturbances (deep hyperaesthesia), psychiatric disorders (apathy or agitation), disturbance of the sleep cycle (with daytime somnolence alternating with insomnia at night), impaired motor functions (paralysis, seizures, tics) and neuroendocrine disorders (amenorrhoea, impotence). in the absence of treatment: cachexia, lethargy, coma and death. rhodesiense hat the first stage is the same as above, but the incubation period is shorter (< 3 weeks), the disease evolves more rapidly and symptoms are more severe. patients often die of myocarditis in 3 to 6 months without having developed signs of the meningo-encephalitic stage. in practice, gambiense and rhodesiense hat can be difficult to differentiate: e.g., there exist cases of acute gambiense infection and others of chronic rhodesiense infection. laboratory diagnosis involves 3 steps for gambiense hat (screening test, diagnostic confirmation and stage determination) and 2 steps for rhodesiense hat (diagnostic confirmation and stage determination). the recommended screening test for t.b. gambiense infection is the catt (card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis). it detects the presence of specific antibodies in the patient’s blood or serum. diagnostic confirmation: presence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirates or in blood using concentration techniques: capillary tube centrifugation technique (woo test), quantitative buffy coat (qbc), mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique (maec). stage determination: detection of trypanosomes (after centrifugation) and white cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture): haemolymphatic stage: no trypanosomes and ≤ 5 white cells/mm3 page 18 8/ 409meningoencephalitic stage: evidence of trypanosomes or > 5 white cells/mm3 treatment (except in pregnant women) due to the toxicity of trypanocides, detection of the parasite is essential before initiating treatment. in the absence of parasitological confirmation, treatment may nevertheless be justified in certain cases: very strong clinical suspicion, patients in life-threatening condition, strong serological suspicion (catt 1:16 positive) in a population where the disease is highly prevalent (> 2%). several treatment regimens exist. check national recommendations and local resistance levels. treatment must be administered under close medical supervision. patients receiving pentamidine can be treated as outpatients but those receiving suramin, eflornithine (with or without nifurtimox) or melarsoprol should be hospitalised. after treatment, patients should be checked every 6 months (clinical examination, lumbar puncture and examination for trypanosomes) over 24 months, to look for relapse. haemolymphatic stage (stage i) gambiense hat pentamidine isetionate deep im children and adults: 4 mg/kg once daily for 7 to 10 days patients should receive a source of glucose (meal, sweet tea) one hour before injection (risk of hypoglycaemia); they should remain supine during administration and one hour after injection (risk of hypotension). rhodesiense hat suramin slow iv children and adults: d1: test dose of 4 to 5 mg/kg d3, d10, d17, d24, d31: 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g per injection) suramin may cause anaphylactic reactions, a test dose is recommended prior to starting treatment. in the event of an anaphylactic reaction after the test dose, the patients must not be given suramin again. meningoencephalitic stage (stage ii) before administrating trypanocides, the priority is to improve the patient’s general condition (rehydration, treatment of malaria, intestinal worms, malnutrition, bacterial infections). it is nonetheless recommended not to postpone the trypanocidal treatment for more than 10 days. gambiense hat first choice: nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (nect) nifurtimox po children and adults: 5 mg/kg 3 times daily for 10 days + eflornithine iv infusion over 2 hours children and adults: 200 mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days the catheter must be handled with great attention to avoid local or general bacterial infections: thoroughly disinfect the insertion site, ensure secure catheter fixation, protect the insertion site with a sterile dressing, systematically change the catheter every 48 hours or earlier in case of signs of phlebitis. second choice: eflornithine iv infusion over 2 hours page 18 9/ 409children under 12 years: 150 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days children 12 years and over and adults: 100 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days in the event of a relapse after nect or eflornithine: melarsoprol slow iv children and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days melarsoprol is highly toxic: reactive encephalopathy (coma, or recurrent or prolonged seizures) in 5 to 10% of treated patients, fatal in around 50% of cases; peripheral neuropathy, invasive diarrhoea, severe skin rash, phlebitis, etc. prednisolone po (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment. rhodesiense hat melarsoprol slow iv children and adults: 2.2 mg/kg once daily for 10 days prednisolone po (1 mg/kg once daily) is frequently combined throughout the duration of treatment. treatment in pregnant women all trypanocides are potentially toxic for the mother and the foetus (risk of miscarriage, malformation, etc.). however, due to the life-threatening risk for the mother and the risk of mother-to-child transmission, treatment must be initiated as follows: haemolymphatic stage: pentamidine for gambiense hat as of the second trimester and suramin for rhodesiense hat. meningoencephalitic stage: treatment depends on the mother's condition: if in immediately life-threatening condition: treatment with nect or eflornithine cannot be deferred until after delivery. if not immediately life-threatening condition: pentamidine for gambiense hat and suramin for rhodesiense hat. treatment with nect or eflornithine is to be administered after delivery. prevention and control individual protection against tsetse fly bites: long sleeves and trousers, repellents, keeping away from risk areas (e.g. near rivers). disease control: mass screening and treatment of patients (t.b. gambiense), trypanocide treatment of cattle (t.b. rhodesiense), vector control using tsetse fly traps or insecticides. page 19 0/ 409american trypanosomiasis (chagas disease) chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoa trypanosoma cruzi. it is transmitted to humans by contact of triatomine bug faeces with a break in the skin (often caused by a bite from the triatomine bug), or with mucous membranes. transmission by contaminated blood transfusion, accidental exposure to blood, mother-to-child (during pregnancy or childbirth) or consumption of contaminated food and water is also possible. chagas disease has two phases: an acute phase, which lasts approximately 4 to 6 weeks, and a chronic phase, which is lifelong if left untreated. the disease is primarily found on the american continent a . it is significantly underdiagnosed. [1] clinical features acute phase most cases are asymptomatic. if transmitted through a break in the skin: a red swelling on the skin (chagoma) or unilateral painless purplish periorbital oedema (romaña's sign) with local lymphadenopathy, headache and fever. rarely: multiple lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, myocarditis (chest pain, dyspnoea), meningoencephalitis (seizures, paralysis). chronic phase many cases remain asymptomatic (indeterminate phase). up to 30% of cases develop organ damage: [2] cardiac lesions (conduction disorders, dilated cardiomyopathy): arrhythmia, dyspnoea, chest pain, heart failure; gastrointestinal lesions (dilation of the oesophagus or colon i.e. megaoesophagus, megacolon): difficulty swallowing, severe constipation. individuals with immunosuppression have a higher risk of developing organ damage than the general population. diagnosis laboratory [1] acute phase: identification of trypanosoma cruzi by direct microscopy of fresh blood or blood concentrated by microhematocrit method. in case of strong clinical suspicion despite no definitive diagnosis from direct microscopy, perform serologic tests after a delay of approximately 1 month (see "chronic phase"). chronic phase: identification of anti-trypanosoma cruzi antibodies by serologic tests, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), hemagglutination inhibition assay (hai), indirect immunofluorescence (iif) or rapid diagnostic test (rdt). for a definitive diagnosis, two different serological tests should be performed simultaneously; in case of conflicting results, a third test is recommended. b other investigations ecg may demonstrate conduction disorders. chest or abdominal x-ray may demonstrate cardiomegaly, megaoesophagus or megacolon. treatment page 19 1/ 409aetiologic treatment acute or chronic chagas disease can be treated with either benznidazole or nifurtimox. however, treatment is not recommended if patient has already developed cardiac or digestive complications. close clinical monitoring should be provided due to the frequent occurrence of adverse effects. where available, blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function tests) should be performed before, during and after treatment. protocols vary according to the country, follow national recommendations. for information: age dose and duration 2 to 12 years [3] 5 to 8 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses for 60 days benznidazole (a) po( > 12 years and adults [4] 5 to 7 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses for 60 days ≤ 10 years 15 to 20 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days nifurtimox 11 to 16 years 12.5 to 15 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days po (b) [3] ≥ 17 years and adults 8 to 10 mg/kg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses for 90 days (a) benznidazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding and in patient with severe hepatic/renal impairment. (b) nifurtimox is contra-indicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, patients with severe hepatic/renal impairment or history of severe mental disorders or seizures. adverse effects (gastrointestinal disturbances, agitation, sleeping disorders, seizure) are frequent and reversible and should not necessarily result in discontinuation of treatment. avoid alcohol and fatty meals during treatment. symptomatic treatment see seizures (chapter 1), pain (chapter 1) and heart failure (chapter 12). prevention individual protection against bite from triatomine bugs: use of long-lasting insecticidal net. in healthcare settings: standard precautions to avoid contamination with soiled materials or potentially infected body fluids. blood transfusions: advise patients with chagas disease not to donate blood. in endemic areas, screen donor blood for trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. footnotes (a) for more information on geographical distribution of cases of t. cruzi infection: http://gamapserver.who.int/maplibrary/files/maps/global_chagas_2009.png (b) if resources are limited, elisa alone can be performed. if the result is positive, a second serologic test should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. references page 19 2/ 4091. pan american health organization. guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of chagas disease. washington, d.c.

409leishmaniases the leishmaniases are a group of parasitic diseases caused by protozoa of the genus leishmania, transmitted by the bite of a sandfly. over 20 species cause disease in man. cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in more than 70 countries in south and central america, middle east, central asia, and africa. mucocutaneous leishmaniasis occurs in latin america and, more rarely, in africa (ethiopia, sudan). visceral leishmaniasis occurs in more than 60 countries in east and north africa, south and central asia, southern europe, and south and central america. clinical features cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis single or multiple lesions on the uncovered parts of the body: an erythematous papule begins at the sandfly bite, enlarges to a nodule and extends in surface and depth to form a scabbed ulcer. ulcers are painless, unless there is secondary bacterial or fungal infection. usually, lesions heal spontaneously, leaving a scar, and result in lifelong protection from disease. lesions may also spread to the mucosa (mouth, nose, conjunctiva) giving rise to the mucocutaneous form, which may cause severe disfigurement. visceral leishmaniasis visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) is a systemic disease, resulting in pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and death if left untreated. prolonged (> 2 weeks) irregular fever, splenomegaly, and weight loss are the main signs. other signs include: anaemia, diarrhoea, epistaxis, lymphadenopathy, moderate hepatomegaly. bacterial diarrhoea, pneumonia, and tuberculosis may develop due to immunosuppression. post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis macular, nodular or papular skin rash of unknown aetiology, particularly on the face, and typically occurring after apparent cure of visceral leishmaniasis. laboratory cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis parasitological diagnosis: identification of giemsa-stained parasites in smears of tissue biopsy from the edge of the ulcer. no useful serological tests. visceral leishmaniasis parasitological diagnosis: identification of giemsa-stained parasites in smears of splenic, bone marrow, or lymph node aspiration-biopsy. splenic aspiration is the most sensitive technique but carries a theoretical risk of potentially fatal haemorrhage. serological diagnosis: rk39 dipstick test and direct agglutination test (dat) can be used for diagnosis of primary visceral leishmaniasis in clinically suspect cases. diagnosis of relapse is only by parasitological confirmation. page 19 4/ 409treatment the various species of leishmania respond differently to drugs. follow national recommendations. for information: cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis cutaneous lesions generally heal spontaneously in 3 to 6 months. treatment is only indicated if lesions are persistent (> 6 months), disfiguring, ulcerating, or disseminated. forms with a single lesion or few lesions: start with local treatment with a pentavalent antimonial: sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate, 1 to 2 ml infiltrated into the lesion if it is a nodule and into the edges and base around the crust if it is an ulcer. it should be repeated every 3 to 7 days for 2 to 4 weeks. once healing begins, the treatment can be stopped and healing will continue. im treatment with a pentavalant antimonial (20 mg/kg daily for 10 to 20 days) is restricted to severe cases and must be administered under close medical supervision. miltefosine po (as for visceral leishmaniasis) for 28 days is effective in many forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis. ulcers are often secondarily infected with streptococci and staphylococci: administer suitable antibiotics. mucocutaneous forms: as for visceral leishmaniasis. visceral leishmaniasis visceral leishmaniasis in east africa first-line treatment: a pentavalent antimonial im or slow iv: 20 mg/kg daily for 17 days + paromomycin im: 15 mg (11 mg base)/kg daily for 17 days second-line treatment for relapse and for specific vulnerable

second-line treatment for relapse: liposomal amphotericin b iv infusion: 3 to 5 mg/kg once daily for 5 to 8 days up to a total dose of 25 mg/kg for all patients with visceral leishmaniasis, hydration, nutritional support and treatment of intercurrent infections (malaria, dysentery, pneumonia, etc.) are essential. tuberculosis and/or hiv infection may also be present and should be suspected if relapse occurs more than once or in the event of treatment failure. page 19 5/ 409post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (pkdl) only patients with severe or disfiguring disease or with lesions remaining

vector control and elimination of animal reservoir hosts. page 19 6/ 409intestinal protozoan infections (parasitic diarrhoea) the most important intestinal protozoan infections are amoebiasis (entamoeba histolytica), giardiasis (giardia lamblia), cryptosporidiosis (cryptosporidium sp), cyclosporiasis (cyclospora cayetanensis) and isosporiasis (isospora belli). intestinal protozoa are transmitted by the faecal-oral route (soiled hands, ingestion of food or water contaminated with faeces) and may cause both individual cases of diarrhoea and epidemic diarrhoea outbreaks. clinical features amoebiasis gives rise to bloody diarrhoea (see amoebiasis, chapter 3). clinical presentation of giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis and isosporiasis is very similar: diarrhoea is usually mild and self-limiting, except in children and patients with advanced hiv disease (cd4 < 200). these patients are likely to develop severe, intermittent or chronic diarrhoea that may be complicated by malabsorption with significant wasting (or failure to gain weight in children) or severe dehydration. stools are usually watery, but steatorrhoea (pale, bulky, fatty stools) may be found in the event of secondary fat malabsorption; stools may contain mucus. diarrhoea is usually associated with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal distension and cramps, flatulence, nausea, anorexia), but patients have low-grade fever or no fever. laboratory definitive diagnosis relies on parasite identification in stool specimens (trophozoites and cysts for giardia; oocysts for cryptosporidium, cyclospora, isospora). two to three samples, collected 2 to 3 days apart are necessary, as pathogens are shed intermittently. treatment correct dehydration if present (for clinical features and management, see dehydration, chapter 1). if the causal agent has been identified in the stool: page 19 7/ 409giardiasis tinidazole po single dose children: 50 mg/kg (max. 2 g) adults: 2 g or metronidazole po for 3 days children: 30 mg/kg once daily adults: 2 g once daily cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent patients, no aetiological treatment; spontaneous resolution in 1 to 2 weeks. cyclosporiasis co-trimoxazole po for 7 days children: 25 mg smx + 5 mg tmp/kg 2 times daily adults: 800 mg smx + 160 mg tmp 2 times daily in immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 1 to 3 weeks. treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms. isoporiasis co-trimoxazole po for 7 to 10 days adults: 800 mg smx + 160 mg tmp 2 times daily in immunocompetent patients, symptoms usually resolve spontaneous in 2 to 3 weeks. treatment is given in case of severe or prolonged symptoms. if reliable stool examination cannot be carried out: parasitic diarrhoeas cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds, nor is it possible to distinguish these from non- parasitic diarrhoeas. an empirical treatment (using tinidazole or metronidazole and co-trimoxazole as above, together or in succession) may be tried in the case of prolonged diarrhoea or steatorrhoea. in patients with hiv infection, see empirical treatment (hiv infections and aids, chapter 8). in patients with advanced hiv disease, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis and isosporiasis are opportunistic infections; the most effective intervention is the treatment of the underlying hiv infection with antiretrovirals. patients remain at high risk for dehydration/death until immunity is restored. page 19 8/ 409flukes page 19 9/ 409infection/epidemiology clinical features/diagnosis treatment

(schistosomes). the three main species infecting humans are schistosoma haematobium, schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma japonicum. schistosoma mekongi and schistosoma intercalatum have a more limited distribution. humans are infected while wading/bathing in fresh water infested with schistosome larvae. symptoms occurring during the phases of parasite invasion (transient localized itching as larvae penetrate the skin) and migration (allergic manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms during migration of schistosomules) are frequently overlooked. in general, schistosomiasis is suspected when symptoms of established infection become evident. each species gives rise to a specific clinical form: genito-urinary schistosomiasis due to s. haematobium, intestinal schistosomiasis due s. mansoni, s. japonicum, s. mekongi and s. intercalatum. the severity of the disease depends on the parasite load. heavily infected patients are prone to visceral lesions with potentially irreversible sequelae. children aged 5 to 15 years are particularly at risk: prevalence and parasite load are highest in this age group. an antiparasitic treatment should be administered to reduce the risk of severe lesions, even if there is a likelihood of re- infection. clinical features page 20 2/ 409clinical features/diagnosis parasite/epidemiology a (established infection) genito-urinary s. haematobium urinary manifestations: schistosomiasis distribution: africa, in endemic areas, urinary schistosomiasis should be madagascar and the suspected in any patients who complain of macroscopic arabian peninsula haematuria (red coloured urine throughout, or at the end of, micturition). haematuria is frequently associated with polyuria/dysuria (frequent and painful micturition). in patients, especially children and adolescents, with urinary symptoms, visual inspection of the urine (and dipstick test for microscopic haematuria if the urine appears grossly normal) is indispensible. presumptive treatment is recommended in the presence of macro- or microscopic haematuria, when parasitological confirmation (parasite eggs detected in urine) cannot be obtained. genital manifestations: in women, symptoms of genital infection (white-yellow or bloody vaginal discharge, itching, lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia) or vaginal lesions resembling genital warts or ulcerative lesions on the cervix; in men, haematospermia (blood in the semen). if left untreated: risk of recurrent urinary tract infections, fibrosis/calcification of the bladder and ureters, bladder cancer; increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections and risk of infertility. in endemic areas, genito-urinary schistosomiasis may be a differential diagnosis to the genito-urinary tuberculosis, and in women, to the sexually transmitted infections (especially in women with an history of haematuria). intestinal s. mansoni non-specific digestive symptoms (abdominal pain; diarrhoea, schistosomiasis distribution: tropical intermittent or chronic, with or without blood) and africa, madagascar, the hepatomegaly. arabian peninsula, south for s. intercalatum: digestive symptoms only (rectal pain, america (especially brazil) tenesmus, rectal prolapse, bloody diarrhoea). s. japonicum if left untreated: risk of hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension, distribution:

(b) the migrating larvae of ancylostoma braziliense and caninum (hookworms of cats and dogs) also present as a pruritic, inflammatory, creeping eruption in humans (cutaneous larva migrans) but with a slower rate of progression and a longer duration (several weeks or months). treatment is with albendazole (400 mg single dose or once daily for 3 days in children > 6 months and adults; 200 mg in children > 6 months but < 10 kg) or ivermectin (200 micrograms/kg single dose). page 21 0/ 409filariasis onchocerciasis (river blindness) loiasis. lymphatic filariasis (lf) filariases are helminthiases due to tissue-dwelling nematode worms (filariae). human to human transmission takes place through the bite of an insect vector. the most important pathogens are outlined in the table below. mixed infections are common in co-endemic regions. each filarial species is found in 2 principal developmental stages: macrofilariae (adult worms) and microfilariae (larval offspring). the treatment depends on the pathogenic stage of the species considered and targets microfilariae for o. volvulus and macrofilariae for the other species. location of location of pathogenic presence species/infections macrofilariae microfilariae stage of wolbachia onchocerca volvulus subcutaneous skin and eye microfilariae yes (onchocerciasis) nodules loa loa subcutaneous blood macrofilariae no (loiasis) tissue wuchereria bancrofti, brugia malayi and brugia timori lymph vessels blood macrofilariae yes (lymphatic filariasis) classical antifilarial agents include diethylcarbamazine (dec), ivermectin and albendazole. doxycycline is used solely in the treatment of o. volvulus and lymphatic filarial worms, which harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium (wolbachia) sensitive to doxycycline. page 21 1/ 409onchocerciasis (river blindness) the distribution of onchocerciasis is linked to that of its vector (simulium), which reproduces near rapidly flowing rivers in intertropical africa (99% of cases), latin america (guatemala, mexico, ecuador, colombia, venezuela, brazil) and yemen. clinical features in endemic areas, the following signs, alone or in combination, are suggestive of onchocerciasis: onchocercomas: painless subcutaneous nodules containing adult worms, usually found over a bony prominence (iliac crest, trochanters, sacrum, rib cage, skull, etc.), measuring several mm or cm in size, firm, smooth, round or oval, mobile or adherent to underlying tissue; single, or multiple and clustered. acute papular onchodermatitis: papular rash, sometimes diffuse but often confined to the buttocks or lower extremities, intensely itchy, associated with scratch marks, often superinfected (“filarial scabies”) a . this arises from dermal invasion by microfilariae. late chronic skin lesions: patchy depigmentation on the shins (“leopard skin”), skin atrophy or areas of dry, thickened, peeling skin (lichenification; “lizard skin”). visual disturbances and ocular lesions: see onchocerciasis, chapter 5. laboratory detection of the microfilariae in the skin (skin snip biopsy, iliac crest). if the skin biopsy is positive, look for loiasis in regions where loiasis is co-endemic (mainly in central africa). treatment antiparasitic treatment diethylcarbamazine is contra-indicated (risk of severe ocular lesions). doxycycline po (200 mg once daily for 4 weeks; if possible 6 weeks) kills a significant percentage of adult worms and progressively reduces the number of o. volvulus microfilariae b . it is contraindicated in children < 8 years and pregnant or breast-feeding women. ivermectin po is the drug of choice: 150 micrograms/kg single dose; a 2nd dose should be administered after 3 months if clinical signs persist. repeat the treatment every 6 or 12 months to maintain the parasite load below the threshold at which clinical signs appear c . ivermectin is not recommended in children < 5 years or < 15 kg and pregnant women. in case of co-infection with loa loa or in regions where loiasis is co-endemic, ivermectin should be administered with caution (risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high l. loa microfilarial load): if it is possible to test for loa loa (thick blood film): confirm and quantify the microfilaraemia. administer the appropriate treatment according to the microfilarial load (see loiasis). if it is not possible to perform a thick film examination, take a history from the patient: if the patient has received a previous treatment with ivermectin without developing serious adverse reactions (see loiasis), administer the treatment. if the patient has never received ivermectin nor developed signs of loiasis (migration of an adult worm under the conjunctiva, or « calabar » swellings), administer the treatment. if the patient already has developed signs of loiaisis and if onchocerciasis has a significant clinical impact, administer ivermectin under close supervision (see loiasis) or use an alternative (doxycycline, as above). page 21 2/ 409in the case of concomitant lymphatic filariasis: administer ivermectin first then start treatment for lymphatic filariasis with doxycycline po (see lymphatic filariasis) one week later. nodulectomy (surgical removal of onchocercomas) nodules are benign, often deep, and their ablation does not treat onchocerciasis. thus, nodulectomy is reserved for cranial nodules (their proximity to the eye is a risk factor for visual compromise) or nodules which are cosmetically unacceptable. in other cases, refrain from nodulectomy. nodulectomy is performed under local anaesthesia, in an appropriately equipped facility. footnotes (a) differential diagnosis is sarcoptic scabies (scabies, chapter 4). (b) elimination of wolbachia reduces the longevity and fertility of the macrofilariae, and thus the production of new microfilariae within the organism. (c) ivermectin kills microfilariae and disrupts production of microfilariae by adult worms. however the treatment must be administered at regular intervals since it does not kill adult worms. page 21 3/ 409loiasis the distribution of loiasis is linked to that of its vector (chrysops) in forests or savannah with gallery forests in west or central africa (limits west: benin; east: uganda; north: sudan and south: angola). clinical features the subconjunctival migration of an adult worm is pathognomonic of loa loa infection. localised subcutaneous swellings, allergic in origin, transient (several hours or days), painless, non-pitting, appearing anywhere on the body, frequently the upper extremities and face, often associated with localised or generalised pruritus (« calabar swellings »). onset of pruritus, in the absence of other signs. subcutaneous migration of an adult worm: pruritic, palpable red cord-like linear lesion, sinuous, advancing (1 cm/hour), disappearing rapidly with no trace a . such migration generally arises following treatment with diethylcarbamazine, rarely spontaneously. laboratory detection of microfilariae in the peripheral blood (thick film, stained with giemsa). blood specimens should be collected between 10 am and 5 pm. quantify microfilaraemia even if the diagnosis is certain, since treatment is determined by the intensity of the parasite load. if the thick film is positive, look for onchocerciasis in regions where onchocerciasis is coendemic (mainly in central africa). treatment antiparasitic treatment diethylcarbamazine (dec) is the only macrofilaricide available but is contra-indicated in: patients with microfilaraemia > 2000 mf/ml (risk of severe encephalopathy, with poor prognosis). patients co-infected with o. volvulus (risk of severe eye lesions). pregnant women, infants, and patients in poor general condition. ivermectin (and possibly albendazole) is used to reduce microfilaraemia before administration of dec; however, ivermectin administration may trigger encephalopathy in patients with very high loa loa microfilaraemia (> 30 000 mf/ml). doxycycline is not indicated since loa loa does not harbour wolbachia. management: 1) l. loa microfilaraemia is < 1,000-2,000 mf/ml a 28-day treatment of dec may be started using a small dose: 6 mg on d1, i.e. 1/8 of a 50 mg tablet 2 times daily. double the dose every day up to 200 mg 2 times daily in adults (1.5 mg/kg 2 times daily in children). if microfilaraemia or symptoms persist, a second treatment is given 4 weeks later. if dec is contra-indicated due to possible or confirmed co-infection with o. volvulus, ivermectin (150 microgams/kg single dose) treats onchocerciasis, and reduces pruritus and frequency of calabar swellings. the treatment may be repeated every month or every 3 months. page 21 4/ 4092) l. loa microfilaraemia is between 2,000 and 8,000 mf/ml reduce microfilaraemia with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose); repeat the treatment every month if necessary; administer dec when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml. 3) l. loa microfilaraemia is between 8,000 and 30,000 mf/ml treatment with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) may cause marked functional impairment for several days. close supervision and support from family member(s) are necessary b . prescribe paracetamol as well for 7 days. 4) l. loa microfilaraemia is > 30,000 mf/ml if the loiasis is well tolerated, it is preferable to refrain from treatment: the disease is benign and treatment with ivermectin may cause very severe adverse reactions (encephalopathy), albeit rarely. if loiasis has a significant clinical impact and/or the patient presents with symptomatic onchocerciasis requiring treatment, ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg single dose) is administered for 5 days under supervision in hospital c . an attempt to first reduce l. loa microfilaraemia using albendazole (200 mg 2 times daily for 3 weeks) is an option. when l. loa microfilaraemia is < 30 000 mf/ml, treat with ivermectin under close supervision and support, then dec when the microfilaraemia is < 2000 mf/ml. extraction of macrofilariae subcutaneous migration of a microfilaria usually results from treatment with dec; the worm will die beneath the skin and extracting it serves no purpose. removal of an adult worm from the conjunctiva: see loasis, chapter 5. footnotes (a) for differential diagnosis, see cutaneous larva migrans. (b) patients may present with various pain syndromes, be unable to move without help or unable to move at all. monitoring is necessary to determine whether the patient can manage activities of daily living, and provide assistance if necessary. if the patient remains bedridden for several days, ensure pressure sores do not develop (mobilisation, repositioning). (c) a severe reaction may occur on d2-d3. it is usually preceded by haemorrhages of the palpebral conjunctiva on d1-d2. routinely check for this sign by turning back the eyelids. symptoms of post ivermectin encephalopathy are reversible and the prognosis favourable, if the patient is correctly managed; the treatment is symptomatic until symptoms resolve. avoid the use of steroids due to adverse effects. page 21 5/ 409lymphatic filariasis (lf) the distribution of lf is linked to that of its mosquito vectors (anopheles, culex, aedes, etc.): w. bancrofti: sub-saharan africa, madagascar, egypt, india, south east asia, pacific region, south america, the caribbean b. malayi: south east asia, china, india, sri lanka b. timori: timor 90% of lf is due to w. bancrofti and 10% to brugia spp. clinical features acute recurrent inflammatory manifestations adenolymphangitis: lymph node(s) and red, warm, tender oedema along the length of a lymphatic channel, with or without systemic signs (e.g. fever, nausea, vomiting). the inflammation may involve the lower limbs, external genitalia and breast. in men: acute inflammation of the spermatic cord (funiculitis), epididymis and testicle (epididymo-orchitis). attacks resolve spontaneously within a week and recur regularly in patients with chronic disease. chronic manifestations lymphoedema: oedema of the lower extremity or external genitalia or breast, secondary to obstruction of the lymphatics by macrofilariae. the oedema is reversible initially but then becomes chronic and increasingly severe: hypertrophy of the area affected, progressive thickening of the skin (fibrous thickening with formation of creases, initially superficial, but then deep, and verrucous lesions). the final stage of lymphoedema is elephantiasis. in men: increase in volume of fluid due to accumulation within the tunica vaginalis (hydrocoele, lymphocoele, chylocoele); chronic epididymo-orchitis. chyluria: milky or rice-water urine (disruption of a lymphatic vessel in the urinary tract). in patients parasitized by brugia spp, genital lesions and chyluria are rare: lymphoedema is usually confined to below the knee. laboratory detection of microfilariae in the peripheral blood (thick film) a ; blood specimens should be collected between 9 pm and 3 am. in regions where loiasis and/or onchocerciasis are co-endemic, check for co-infection if the lf diagnosis is positive. treatment antiparasitic treatment treatment is not administered during an acute attack. doxycycline po, when administered as a prolonged treatment, eliminates the majority of macrofilariae and reduces lymphoedema: 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks minimum. it is contraindicated in children < 8 years and pregnant or breast-feeding women. diethylcarbamazine po single dose (400 mg in adults; 3 mg/kg in children) may be an alternative but eliminates a variable proportion of adult worms (up to 40%) and does not relieve symptoms; a prolonged treatment is no more effective than single dose therapy. in addition, dec is contra-indicated in patients with onchocerciasis or loa loa microfilarial load > 2000 mf/ml and in pregnant and breast-feeding women. page 21 6/ 409ivermectin (weak or absent macrofilaricidal effect) and albendazole should not be used for the treatment of individual cases (no effect on symptoms). in the case of confirmed or probable co-infection with o. volvulus: treat onchocerciasis first, then administer doxycycline. control/prevention of inflammatory manifestations and infectious complications acute attacks: bed rest, elevation of the affected limb without bandaging, cooling of the affected limb (wet cloth, cold bath) and analgesics; antibacterial or antifungal cream if necessary; antipyretics if fever (paracetamol) and hydration. prevention of episodes of lymphangitis and lymphoedema: hygiene of the affected extremity b , comfortable footwear, immediate attention to secondary bacterial/fungal infections and wounds. established lymphoedema: bandaging of the affected limb by day, elevation of the affected extremity (after removal of the bandage) when at rest, simple exercises (flexion-extension of the feet when recumbent or upright, rotation of the ankles); skin hygiene, as above. surgery may be indicated in the treatment of chronic manifestations: advanced lymphoedema (diversion-reconstruction), hydrocoele and its complications, chyluria. footnotes (a) when test results are negative in a clinically suspect case, consider detection of antigens (ict rapid test) and/or ultrasound of the inguinal area in search of the « filarial dance sign ». (b) wash at least once daily (soap and water at room temperature), paying special attention to folds and interdigital areas; rinse thoroughly and dry with a clean cloth; nail care. page 21 7/

irreversible neurological damage and auditory impairment. bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. the treatment is based on early parenteral administration of antibiotics that penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf). empiric antibiotic therapy is administered if the pathogen cannot be identified or while waiting for laboratory results. the main bacteria responsible vary depending on age and/or context: meningitis in a non-epidemic context children 0 to 3 months: children ≤ 7 days: gram-negative bacilli (klebsiella spp, e. coli, s. marcescens, pseudomona spp, salmonella spp) and group b streptococcus children > 7 days: s. pneumoniae accounts for 50% of all bacterial meningitis l. monocytogenes is occasionally responsible for meningitis during this period. children 3 months-5 years: s. pneumoniae, h. influenza b and n. meningitidis children > 5 years and adults: s. pneumoniae and n. meningitidis special conditions: immunodepressed patients (hiv, malnourished): high percentage of gram- negative bacilli (specially salmonella spp) and also m. tuberculosis. sickle cell anaemia: salmonella spp and staphylococcus aureus are frequent causes. meningitis may be related to s. aureus when associated with skin infection or skull fracture. meningitis in an epidemic context in the sahelian region (but not exclusively, e.g. rwanda, angola, brazil), during the dry season, epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (neisseria meningitidis a or c or w135) affect children from 6 months of age, adolescents and adults. in these regions, whether during epidemics or not, all the above pathogens can be found, especially in young children. clinical features the clinical presentation depends on the patient's age. children over 1 year and adults fever, severe headache, photophobia, neck stiffness brudzinski's sign (neck flexion in a supine patient results in involuntary flexion of the knees) and kernig's sign (attempts to extend the knee from the flexed-thigh position are met with strong passive resistance). petechial or ecchymotic purpura (usually in meningococcal infections) in severe forms: coma, seizures, focal signs, purpura fulminans children under 1 year the classic signs of meningitis are usually absent. the child is irritable, appears sick with fever or hypothermia, poor feeding or vomiting. other features include: seizures, apnoea, altered consciousness, bulging fontanelle (when not crying); occasionally, neck stiffness and purpuric rash. page 21 9/ 409laboratory lumbar puncture (lp): macroscopic examination of csf:

hyperextension of spine [opisthotonus]), to the abdomen (guarding) and to the limbs (flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs). muscle spasms, which are very painful, appear at the onset or when muscular rigidity becomes generalised. they are triggered by stimuli (noise, light, touch) or arise spontaneously. spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles may cause respiratory distress or aspiration. neonates in 90% of cases, initial symptoms appear within 3 to 14 days of birth. the first signs are significant irritability and difficulty sucking (rigidity of the lips, trismus) then rigidity becomes generalised, as in adults. any neonate, who initially sucked and cried normally, presenting with irritability and difficulty sucking 3 to 28 days after birth and demonstrating rigidity and muscle spasms should be assumed to have neonatal tetanus. treatment hospitalisation is needed and usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks. correct management can reduce mortality even in hospitals with limited resources. general measures ensure intensive nursing care. the patient should be in a dark, quiet room. blindfold neonates with a cloth bandage. page 22 4/ 409handle the patient carefully, while sedated and as little as possible; change position every 3 to 4 hours to avoid bedsores. teach family the danger signs and instruct them to call the nurse for the slightest respiratory symptom (cough, difficulty breathing, apnoea, excessive secretions, cyanosis, etc.). establish iv access for hydration, iv injections. gentle suction of secretions (mouth, oropharynx). insert a nasogastric tube for hydration, feeding and administration of oral medications. provide hydration and nutrition in feeds divided over 24 hours. in neonates, give expressed breast milk every 3 hours (risk of hypoglycaemia). neutralisation of toxin human tetanus immunoglobulin im neonates, children and adults: 500 iu single dose, injected into 2 separate sites inhibition of toxin production metronidazole a iv infusion (30 minutes; 60 minutes in neonates) for 7 days neonates: 0 to 7 days: 15 mg/kg on d1 then, after 24 hours, 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours 8 days to < 1 month (< 2 kg): same doses 8 days to < 1 month (≥ 2 kg): 15 mg/kg every 12 hours children 1 month and over: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (max. 1500 mg daily) adults: 500 mg every 8 hours control of rigidity and spasms, and sedation of the patient diazepam should decrease the frequency and intensity of spams without causing respiratory depression. the dose and frequency of administration depend on the patient’s clinical response and tolerance. there is a high risk of respiratory depression and hypotension when using diazepam, especially in children and elderly patients. constant and close monitoring of the patient‘s respiratory rate (rr) and oxygen saturation (spo ) is essential, with immediate availability of equipment for manual ventilation (ambu bag, face mask) and 2 intubation, suction (electric if possible) and ringer lactate. a continuous iv infusion of diazepam requires the use of a dedicated vein (no other infusion/injection in this vein); avoid the antecubital fossa if possible. do not stop treatment abruptly; an abrupt stop can cause spasms. page 22 5/ 409neonates diazepam emulsion for injection (10 mg ampoule, 5 mg/ml, 2 ml) 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg by slow iv injection (3 to 5 minutes) every 1 to 4 hours depending on the severity and the persistence of the spasms as long as the rr is ≥ 30. if despite hourly diazepam the spasms persist, start a continuous infusion of diazepam with an electric syringe: 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/hour (2.4 to 12 mg/kg every 24 hours). start with 0.1 mg/kg/hour and if symptoms persist, increase by 0.1 mg/kg/hour as long as rr is ≥ 30. if in spite of 0.5 mg/kg/hour symptoms persist, the dose can be increased up to 0.8 mg/kg/hour as long as the rr ≥ 30. diluted diazepam emulsion does not keep for more than 6 hours. example: neonate weighing 3 kg (administration by electric syringe) 0.1 mg/kg/hour x 3 kg = 0.3 mg/hour dilute one 10 mg ampoule of diazepam emulsion for injection in 50 ml of 10% glucose to obtain a solution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml. administer 1.5 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) ÷ dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour i.e. 0.3 (mg/hour) ÷ 0.2 (mg/ml) = 1.5 ml/hour]. if an electric syringe is not available, diluting the diazepam emulsion in an infusion bag for continuous infusion may be considered. weigh the risks associated with this mode of administration (accidental bolus or insufficient dose). the infusion should be monitored closely to avoid any change, however small, of the prescribed rate. children same doses and protocol as in neonates but: > 1 use diazepam solution for injection 5 mg/ml: (10 mg ampoule, 5 mg/ml, 2 ml). (a) month these doses can be administered as long as the rr is: and ≥ 30 in children under 1 year adults ≥ 25 in children 1 to 4 years ≥ 20 in children 5 to 12 years ≥ 14 in children over 12 years ≥ 12 in adults examples: child weighing 6 kg (continuous iv infusion using a pediatric infusion set; 1 ml = 60 drops) 0.1 mg/kg/hour x 6 kg = 0.6 mg/hour dilute one 10 mg ampoule of diazepam solution for injection in 50 ml of 5% glucose (10% glucose if child < 3 months) to obtain a solution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml. administer 3 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) ÷ dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour i.e. 0.6 (mg/hour) ÷ 0.2 (mg/ml) = 3 ml/hour] or 3 drops/minute (in a paediatric infusion set ml/hour = drops/minute). adult weighing 60 kg (standard adult infusion set, 1 ml = 20 drops) 0.1 mg/kg/hour x 60 kg = 6 mg/hour dilute 5 ampoules of 10 mg of diazepam solution (50 mg) in 250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose to obtain a solution containing 0.2 mg of diazepam per ml. administer 30 ml/hour [dose (in mg/hour) ÷ dilution (in mg/ml) = dose in ml/hour e.g. 6 (mg/hour) ÷ 0.5 (mg/ml) = 30 ml/hour] or 10 drops/minute. (a) administer the first dose rectally if an iv cannot be placed immediately. count the volume of the infusion of diazepam as part of the patient’s daily fluid intake. page 22 6/ 409when the frequency and severity of the spasms have decreased, start weaning the diazepam (gradually decrease the rate of infusion): calculate the total daily dose of iv diazepam and administer it orally in 4 divided doses, 6 hours apart, via nasogastric (ng) b tube. give first ng dose and decrease rate of iv infusion by 50%. give second ng dose and stop iv diazepam infusion. if withdrawal signs c appear, wean more slowly. once on diazepam po, wean by 10 to 20% of the original dose daily, until at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg every 6 hours. then increase the interval from every 6 hours to every 8 hours for 24 hours as tolerated (wean more slowly if withdrawal signs appear). continue to increase the interval between the doses from every 8 hours to every 12 hours and then to every 24 hours before stopping the diazepam. each step should be for 24 hours or more if withdrawal signs appear. notes: it is often at these smaller doses that it is difficult to wean diazepam. if this is the case, slow the wean further: dropping the % wean (e.g. 5% wean every 24 hours instead of 10% wean) or increasing the interval between weans (e.g. going from every 24 hours to every 48 hours). if the patient is also receiving morphine, wean diazepam first then, wean morphine. non-pharmacological measures to reduce withdrawal: reduce environmental stimuli; swaddle infants, frequent feedings. infants who have had tetanus remain hypertonic, even when they are no longer having spams. treatment of pain morphine po (via nasogastric tube) if necessary (see pain, chapter 1). when morphine is administered with diazepam the risk of respiratory depression is increased, thus closer monitoring is required. when morphine is no longer required, wean the same way as diazepam. treatment of the entry point and associated infections search systematically the entry wound. provide local treatment under sedation: cleansing and for deep wounds, irrigation and debridement. cord infection: do not excise or debride; treat bacterial omphalitis and sepsis, add to metronidazole iv: cloxacillin iv + cefotaxime iv or cloxacillin iv + gentamicin iv (for doses, see bacterial meningitis). tetanus vaccination as tetanus does not confer immunity, vaccination against tetanus must be administered once the patient has recovered. in case of neonatal tetanus, initiate the vaccination of the mother. prevention of critical importance, given the difficulty of treating tetanus once established. 1) post-exposure prophylaxis in all cases: cleansing and disinfection of the wound, and removal of any foreign body. antibiotics are not prescribed routinely for prophylaxis. the decision to administer an antibiotic (metronidazole or penicillin) is made on a case-by-case basis, according to the patient’s clinical status. page 22 7/ 409depending on pre-exposure vaccination status: tetanus vaccine (tv) d and immunoglobulin: see indications below. complete vaccination (3 or more doses) incomplete vaccination time since administration of last dose: (less than 3 doses) type of wound or no vaccination < 5 years 5-10 years > 10 years or unknown status tv minor, clean none none 1 booster initiate or complete tv dose tv tv initiate or complete tv other none 1 booster 1 booster dose and administer tetanus immunoglobulin dose tetanus vaccine im children and adults: 0.5 ml per dose if no vaccination or unknown vaccination status: administer at least 2 doses at an interval of 4 weeks. if incomplete vaccination: administer one dose. then, to ensure long-lasting protection, administer additional doses to complete a total of 5 doses, as indicated in the table below. human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin im children and adults: 250 iu single dose; 500 iu for wounds more than 24 hours old. inject the vaccine and the immunoglobulin in 2 different sites, using a separate syringe for each. 2) routine vaccination (pre-exposure prophylaxis) children: 6 doses in total: a first series of 3 doses of dtp or dtp + hepb or dtp + hepb + hib before the age of 1 year, administered at an interval of 1 month (e.g. at the age of 6, 10 and 14 weeks), then a dose of a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid between the age of 12 and 23 months, a dose between the age of 4 to 7 years, then a dose between the age of 12 and 15 years. women of childbearing age: 5 doses during the reproductive years: a series of 3 doses of td with an interval of at least one month between the first and second dose and an interval of at least 6 months between the second and third dose, then two other doses, each at minimum interval of one year, e.g. during pregnancies (see table below). pregnant women: if a woman has never been vaccinated or if her vaccination status is unknown: 2 doses of td during the pregnancy to reduce the risk of tetanus in mother and neonate: the first as soon as possible during the pregnancy and the second at least 4 weeks later and at least 2 weeks before delivery. this vaccination schedule protects more than 80% of neonates from tetanus. a single dose offers no protection page 22 8/ 409dose vaccination schedule in adults degree and duration of protection on first contact with the health care system tv1 no protection or as soon as possible during pregnancy 80% tv2 at least 4 weeks after tv1 1 to 3 years 6 months to 1 year after tv2 95% tv3 or during the following pregnancy 5 years 1 to 5 years after tv3 99% tv4 or during the following pregnancy 10 years 1 to 10 years after tv4 99% tv5 or during the following pregnancy throughout the reproductive years footnotes (a) clindamycin iv for 7 days is an alternative (for doses, see periorbital and orbital cellulitis, chapter 5). (b) administration of oral diazepam tablets to infants: calculate the exact dose of diazepam, e.g. to obtain 0.5 mg of diazepam, cut a scored diazepam 2 mg tablet in half along scoring then split in half again. crush quarter tablet and dissolve in expressed breast milk or infant formula. (c) withdrawal signs: excessive irritability, tremors, increased muscle tone, frequent yawning, poor feeding, watery stools and sweating. (d) tetanus-containing vaccine, such as td or dtp or dtp + hepb or dtp + hepb + hib according to availability and patient’s age. page 22 9/ 409enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fevers last updated: march 2024 enteric fevers include typhoid fever, due to salmonella enterica serotype typhi (s. typhi) and paratyphoid fever, due to salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi a, b or c (s. paratyphi). enteric fevers are acquired by the ingestion of water or food contaminated with excreta of symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers or by direct contact (dirty hands). enteric fevers are endemic in south, central and southeast asia, sub-saharan africa, oceania and, to a lesser extent, in latin america. effective treatment significantly reduces the risk of complications and death. clinical features clinical manifestations of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are the same. enteric fevers have insidious onset and vary from mild to severe. the characteristic sign is prolonged fever, which gradually increases during the first week, plateaus the second week then decreases between the third and fourth week. non-specific signs and symptoms are frequently associated: gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea, vomiting), headache, malaise, chills, fatigue, non productive cough and/or hepatosplenomegaly. erythematous maculopapular rash on the trunk extreme fatigue and/or relative bradycardia (heart rate-temperature dissociation) may be present. serious complications affect about 27% of hospitalised patients [1] and usually occur during the second or third week of illness. these may incude decreased level of consciousness, intestinal haemorrhage or perforation or peritonitis, shock, or nephritis. in pregnant women, severe infection may lead to foetal complications (miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine death). relapse may occur 2 to 3 weeks after recovery. it is usually not due to antibiotic resistance, and re-treatment is required. clinical diagnosis is difficult as enteric fevers resembles other infections present in regions where they are endemic. the main differential diagnoses are: malaria, brucellosis, leptospirosis, typhus, rickettsiosis, sepsis and dengue. laboratory culture of s. typhi or paratyphi and drug susceptibility test (blood and stool specimens). in all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see malaria, chapter 6). widal agglutination test, other serologic tests, and rapid diagnostic tests are not recommended (low sensitivity and specificity). treatment in all cases hydrate and treat fever (chapter 1). fever usually resolves 4 to 5 days after starting effective antibiotic treatment. choice of antibiotic treatment depends on the susceptibility of the strain, or when susceptibility is unknown, on recent data on susceptibility of strains in the region. check national recommendations. for information: page 23 0/ 409strains resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin/amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole (multidrug-resistant, mdr strains) are present in most parts of the world. ciprofloxacin is used as first-line treatment in some countries, however fluoroquinolone resistance is endemic in asia and is increasing in several parts of the world [2] . ceftriaxone resistance has been identified in several regions [2] . mdr strains also resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins (extensively drug-resistant, xdr strains) have developed [3] . uncomplicated cases (outpatients) uncomplicated cases (the vast majority of cases) can be treated with an oral antibiotic treatment. first-line antibiotics: azithromycin po for 7 days (including for mdr and xdr cases, and pregnant women) children: 10 to 20 mg/kg (max. 1 g) once daily adults: 500 mg to 1 g once daily or 1 g on d1 then 500 mg once daily or cefixime po for 10 to 14 days (except for third-generation cephalosporin resistance and xdr cases) children: 10 mg/kg (max. 200 mg) 2 times daily adults: 200 mg 2 times daily alternatives include, only if recent data show susceptibility of strains to these antibiotics in the region: amoxicillin po for 14 days children: 30 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 3 times daily adults: 1 g 3 times daily or co-trimoxazole po for 14 days children: 20 mg smx + 4 mg tmp/kg (max. 800 mg smx + 160 mg tmp) 2 times daily adults: 800 mg smx + 160 mg tmp 2 times daily severe cases (inpatients) severe cases include: toxic appearance or decreased level of consciousness or medical or surgical complication; oral administration not possible due to persistent vomiting. these cases should be treated under close monitoring. antibiotic treatment is initially parenteral, then oral when there is decreasing fever, clinical improvement and the patient can tolerate oral treatment. start with ceftriaxone iv a (including for pregnant women) children: 50 to 100 mg/kg (max. 4 g) once daily adults: 2 g once daily or 2 times daily then change to azithromycin po (as above) to complete at least 7 days of treatment. for suspected or confirmed ceftriaxone resistance or xdr stains, use meropenem iv, including for pregnant women, then change to azithromycin po to complete at least 7 days of treatment. additional measures in case of decreased level of consciousness or shock, dexamethasone iv: a loading dose of 1 mg/kg followed by 0.25 mg/kg every 6 hours for 48 hours (total of 8 doses). treat in intensive care unit patients with shock, significant intestinal haemorrhage or suspected perforation/peritonitis. if suspected perforation/peritonitis, get urgent surgical review and add metronidazole to ceftriaxone for anaerobic bacterial coverage b . prevention page 23 1/ 409hygiene measures common to all diarrhoeas: handwashing; consumption of treated water (chlorinated, boiled, bottled, etc.); washing/cooking of food, etc. in hospitals: for patients with watery diarrhoea, consider disinfection of excreta with chlorinated solution, if stools are collected in buckets. vaccination with the typhoid conjugate vaccine in endemic regions c . this vaccine can be used to control typhoid outbreaks. it does not protect against paratyphoid fever. footnotes (a) the solvent of ceftriaxone for im injection contains lidocaine. ceftriaxone reconstituted using this solvent must never be administered by iv route. for iv administration, water for injection must always be used. (b) do not add metronidazole if the patient receives meropenem (meropenem already covers anaerobic bacteria).

livestock animals. the main routes of transmission to humans are: digestive, by ingestion of unpasteurized milk (or unpasteurized milk products) from an infected animal; cutaneous, by direct contact with infected animals or carcasses of infected animals. brucellosis is caused by bacteria of the genus brucella, particularly b. melitensis (sheep and goats), b. abortus (cattle), b. suis (pigs). the disease is found worldwide and mainly in rural areas. after primary infection relapses may occur (5 to 15% of cases, even months after end of initial treatment) or the infection may become chronic. clinical features acute form (primary infection) remittent or intermittent fever (39-40 °c), associated with several signs or symptoms: chills, night sweats, joint and muscle pain, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, headache; adenopathies (particularly in children). may be associated with: non-specific gastrointestinal disorders, cough, hepato and/or splenomegaly, arthritis (knee), orchitis. diagnosis is difficult because of the broad spectrum of fluctuating and non-specific clinical manifestations. in patients with unexplained fever, brucellosis should be considered when risk factors are present: consumption of unpasteurized milk products; exposure to livestock (e.g. livestock farmers, veterinarians, butchers, slaughterhouse workers). localised form primary infection may progress to localised infection (even several months or years later), mainly: osteoarticular: sacroiliac joint and often particularly lower limbs joints; spine (intervertebral disk infection, vertebral osteomyelitis) genito-urinary: orchitis, epididymitis pulmonary: bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy neurological : meningitis, encephalitis, polyneuritis paraclinical investigations laboratory blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis. it is positive only in the acute phase. the bacteria grow slowly (7 to 21 days). serological tests (rose bengal, wright agglutination test, indirect immunofluorescence, elisa, etc.) provide presumptive diagnoses. in the event of neurological signs or meningitis, lumbar puncture shows clear cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that may contain high white blood cell count; high protein concentration in csf; low csf glucose. rule out malaria in endemic regions (rapid test). exclude tuberculosis if cough > 2 weeks (sputum smear microscopy). page 23 3/ 409radiography joint pain (hips, knees, ankles, vertebrae, sacroiliac joint): small erosions or destruction or joint space narrowing. often involves the spine, particularly the lumbar spine, causing spondylodiskitis. pulmonary signs: chest x-ray often normal. there may be consolidation, nodules, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion. treatment check national recommendations on antibiotic therapy.

affects many wild and domestic mammals, particularly rodents. plague is transmitted to man by infected animals (direct contact or inhalation of their respiratory secretions), the bite of a flea of infected animals, or inhalation of respiratory secretions of individuals with pneumonic plague. natural foci of infection include africa, asia, north and south america, and parts of europe. bubonic plague is the most common form, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea. without prompt treatment, the bacteria may be disseminated by haematogenous route, producing a more severe form (see below) with a high mortality rate. the following forms of plague may be primary or secondary to bubonic plague: pneumonic plague can rapidly progress to respiratory distress, shock, and death without prompt treatment. septicaemic plague is a fulminant illness that can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation, respiratory distress, shock, and death. plague meningitis is a rare but very severe form of plague. clinical features see table below. main differential diagnoses include: other causes of lymphadenitis (e.g. some bacterial skin infections, tularemia, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid) acute pneumonia (chapter 2) other causes of septicaemia (see shock, chapter 1) or meningitis (see bacterial meningitis, chapter 7) laboratory collect pre-treatment specimens: lymph node aspirate (bubonic plague), sputum (pneumonic plague), blood (septicaemic plague), or cerebrospinal fluid (plague meningitis). send specimens a to reference laboratory for: rapid diagnostic test for detection of f1 capsular antigen of y. pestis pcr culture of y. pestis and drug suceptibility test in all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see malaria, chapter 6). management start empiric antibiotic treatment for 10 to 14 days as soon as plague is suspected, before results of diagnosis tests are available. a combination of 2 antibiotics from different classes is recommended in severe disease, plague meningitis, and pregnant women. follow national recommendations according to antibiotic resistance patterns if known. for

domestic and wild animals, mainly rodents (particularly rats) but also dogs and cattle, etc. it is transmitted to humans by contact through skin lesions or mucous membranes (e.g. eyes, mouth) with: freshwater or moist soil contaminated with urine of an infected animal (indirect contact); urine, blood and other body fluids or tissues of an infected animal (direct contact). it is caused by bacteria (spirochetes) of the genus leptospira. leptospirosis occurs worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. there are often outbreaks after heavy rainfall or flooding. clinical features approximately 90% of cases are asymptomatic or mild with a favourable outcome. 5 to 15% of cases present a severe form with multiple organ dysfunction and a high mortality rate without prompt treatment. mild form acute phase (septicaemic): sudden onset of high fever with chills, headache, myalgia (especially calf and lumbar pain), photophobia, ocular pain. bilateral conjunctival suffusion affecting the bulbar conjunctiva (redness without discharge) is a characteristic sign, but not always present. may be associated with: gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), non- productive cough, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and sometimes, skin rash. immune phase: the signs of the acute phase regress after 5 to 7 days then reappear for a few days usually in a milder form (milder fever, less severe myalgia) then disappear. signs of meningitis (thought to be of immune origin) are however very common during this phase. severe or ictero-haemorrhagic form the onset is the same but a few days later the symptoms worsen: renal disorders (oliguria or polyuria), hepatic disorder (jaundice), widespread haemorrhages (purpura, ecchymoses, epistaxis, haemoptysis, etc.), pulmonary signs (chest pain) or cardiac signs (myocarditis, pericarditis). diagnosis is difficult because of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. patients that present the following should be considered as suspected cases of leptospirosis [1] : abrupt onset of fever, chills, conjunctival suffusion, headache, myalgia and jaundice and one or more risk factors for infection: exposure to contaminated freshwater (e.g. swimming, fishing, rice fields, flooding) or infected animals (e.g. crop and livestock farmers, veterinarians, butchers and slaughterhouse workers). other conditions to consider include a wide range of acute febrile illnesses, e.g.: viral haemorrhagic fevers, dengue, chikungunya, zika, influenza, measles, viral hepatitis, other causes of meningitis page 24 0/ 409malaria typhoid fever, brucellosis, rickettsioses laboratory diagnosis collect pre-treatment specimens and send them to reference laboratory: acute phase (first week of illness): blood and/or serum for igm screening, pcr, and acute specimen for microscopic agglutination test (mat); immune phase (second week of illness): serum for igm screening and convalescent specimen for mat, and urine for pcr. in all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see malaria, chapter 6). other investigations (if available) serum creatinine: elevated if renal dysfunction. full blood count: possible neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia (acute phase), or anaemia secondary to haemorrhage (immune phase). cerebrospinal fluid (immune phase): features of aseptic meningitis in csf (see viral meningitis, chapter 7). urine: mild proteinuria, leukocyturia, possible microscopic haematuria (acute phase). treatment start empiric antibiotic treatment as soon as leptospirosis suspected, before results of diagnosis tests are available. mild form (outpatients) symptomatic treatment rest and treatment of pain and fever: paracetamol po (chapter 1). acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is contra-indicated (risk of haemorrhage). antibiotic treatment doxycycline po for 7 days children under 45 kg: 2 to 2.2 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) 2 times daily children 45 kg and over and adults: 100 mg 2 times daily or, particularly in pregnant women: azithromycin po for 3 days children: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) on d1 then 5 mg/kg (max. 250 mg) once daily on d2 and d3 adults : 1 g on d1 then 500 mg once daily on d2 and d3 or, if not available, amoxicillin po for 7 days children: 25 mg/kg (max. 1 g) 2 times daily adults: 1 g 2 times daily antibiotic treatment can trigger a jarisch-herxheimer reaction (high fever, chills, fall in blood pressure and sometimes shock). it is recommended to monitor the patient for 2 hours after the first dose of antibiotic for occurrence and management of severe jarisch-herxheimer reaction (symptomatic treatment of shock). severe form (inpatients) symptomatic treatment page 24 1/ 409specific management according to organs affected. oliguria generally responds to correction of hypovolaemia. rest and treatment of pain and fever: paracetamol po (chapter 1). avoid or use paracetamol with caution in patients with hepatic involvement. antibiotic treatment ceftriaxone iv for 7 days a children: 80 to 100 mg/kg (max. 2 g) once daily adults: 2 g once daily or benzylpenicillin iv for 7 days children: 50 000 iu (30 mg)/kg (max. 2 miu or 1200 mg) every 6 hours adults: 1 to 2 miu (600 to 1200 mg) every 6 hours prevention avoid bathing in freshwater in endemic areas. disinfect laundry and objects soiled by urine of

relapsing fever (lbrf) tick-borne relapsing fever (tbrf) relapsing fever (fr) is caused by spirochetes of the genus borrelia, transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors. page 24 3/ 409louse-borne relapsing fever (lbrf) last updated: october 2022 lbrf is caused by borrelia recurrentis. it occurs in epidemic waves when conditions favourable to the transmission of body lice are met: cold climate/season, overcrowding and very poor sanitation (e.g. refugee camps, prisons). endemic foci of lbrf are mainly the sudan and the horn of africa (especially ethiopia). lbrf can be associated with louse- borne typhus (see eruptive rickettsioses). the mortality rate for untreated lbrf ranges from 15 to 40%. clinical features relapsing fever is characterized by febrile episodes separated by afebrile periods of approximately 7 days (4 to 14 days). the initial febrile episode lasts up to 6 days: sudden onset of high fever (axillary temperature > 39 °c), severe headache and asthenia, diffuse pain (muscle, joint, back pain), often associated with gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea). splenomegaly is common; bleeding signs (e.g. petechiae, subconjunctival haemorrhage, epistaxis, bleeding gums), jaundice or neurological symptoms may be observed. the febrile episode terminates in a crisis with an elevation in temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, followed by a fall in temperature and blood pressure, which may last for several hours. following the initial febrile episode, the cycle usually reccurs; each episode is less severe than the previous one and the patient develops temporary immunity. complications: collapse during defervescence, myocarditis, cerebral haemorrhage; during pregnancy: abortion, preterm delivery, in utero foetal death, neonatal death. in practice, in an applicable epidemiological setting (see above), a suspect case of lbrf is, according to who, a patient with high fever and two of the following symptoms: severe joint pain, chills, jaundice or signs of bleeding (nose or other bleeding) or a patient with high fever who is responding poorly to antimalarial drugs. clothing should be checked for the presence of body lice and nits. laboratory the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of borrelia in thick or thin blood films (giemsa stain). blood samples must be collected during febrile periods. spirochetes are not found in the peripheral blood during afebrile periods. in addition, the number of circulating spirochetes tends to decrease with each febrile episode. treatment antibiotic treatment (suspect or confirmed cases and close contacts): doxycycline po children: 4 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) single dose adults: 200 mg single dose or erythromycin po children under 5 years: 250 mg single dose children 5 years and over and adults: 500 mg single dose page 24 4/ 409or azithromycin po children: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) single dose adults: 500 mg single dose treatment of pain and fever (paracetamol po) and prevention or treatment of dehydration in the event of associated diarrhoea. elimination of body lice is essential in control of epidemics (see pediculosis, chapter 4). page 24 5/ 409tick-borne relapsing fever (tbrf) last update: october 2022 tbrfs are caused by different borrelia species. they are endemic in temperate and warm regions of the word, especially in africa (tanzania, drc, senegal, mauritania, mali, the horn of africa) and mainly in rural areas. tbrf is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and pregnant women. the mortality rate for untreated tbrf ranges from 2 to 15%. clinical features the clinical manifestations and complications of tbrf are similar to those of lbrf but central nervous system (cns) involvement (particularly lymphocytic meningitis) is more frequent than in lbrf and the number of relapses is higher. the clinical diagnosis is difficult, especially during the first episode: cases occur sporadically rather than in outbreaks; the tick bite is painless and usually unnoticed by the patient; symptoms are very similar to those of malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, certain arbovirosis (yellow fever, dengue) or rickettsiosis, and meningitis. laboratory as for lbrf, the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of borrelia in the patient’s blood. repeat the examination if the first smear is negative despite strong clinical suspicion. in all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see malaria, chapter 6). treatment antibiotic treatment: doxycycline po for 7 to 10 days children under 45 kg: 2.2 mg/kg (max. 100 mg) 2 times daily children 45 kg and over and adults: 100 mg 2 times daily or azithromycin po for 7 to 10 days (if doxycycline is contra-indicated or not available) children: 10 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) once daily adults: 500 mg once daily or ceftriaxone iv a for 10 to 14 days (for pregnant women or in case of cns involvement) children: 50 to 75 mg/kg (max. 2 g) once daily adults: 2 g once daily treatment of pain and fever (paracetamol po) and prevention or treatment of dehydration in the event of associated diarrhoea. antibiotic treatment can trigger a jarisch-herxheimer reaction with high fever, chills, fall in blood pressure and sometimes shock. it is recommended to monitor the patient for 2 hours after the first dose of antibiotic, for occurrence and management of severe jarisch-herxheimer reaction (symptomatic treatment of shock). jarisch-herxheimer reaction appears to occur more frequently in lbrf than in tbrf. page 24 6/ 409footnotes (a) for iv administration of ceftriaxone, dilute with water for injection only. page 24 7/ 409eruptive rickettsioses last update: october 2022 rickettsioses are eruptive fevers caused by bacteria of the genus rickettsia and transmitted to man by an arthropod vector. three main groups are distinguished: typhus group, spotted fever group and scrub typhus group. clinical features common to all forms: sudden onset of fever (temperature of over 39 °c) with severe headache and myalgias. 3 to 5 days later; onset of generalised cutaneous eruption (see below). hypotension; non-dissociated rapid heart rate (variable). typhoid state: prostration, obnubilation, confusion and extreme asthenia, particularly marked in typhus forms. inoculation eschar: painless, black crusted

tick bites by wearing clothing and using repellents. scrub typhus: use of repellents, chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline po (200 mg once weekly in adults). footnotes (a) unlike borrelioses, antibiotic treatment of rickettsioses does not provoke a jarisch-herxheimer reaction. however, the geographical distribution of borrelioses and rickettsioses may overlap, and thus a reaction may occur due to a possible co- infection (see borreliosis). page 25 0/ 409chapter 8: viral diseases measles poliomyelitis rabies viral hepatitis dengue viral haemorrhagic fevers hiv infection and aids page 25 1/ 409measles measles is a highly contagious acute viral infection, transmitted by the airborne route (inhalation of respiratory droplets spread by infected individuals). the disease mainly affects children under 5 years of age and can be prevented by immunization. for more information, refer to the guide management of a measles epidemic, msf. clinical features the average incubation period is 10 days. prodromal or catarrhal phase (2 to 4 days) high fever (39-40 °c) with cough, coryza (nasal discharge) and/or conjunctivitis (red and watery eyes). koplik’s spots: tiny bluish-white spots on an erythematous base, found on the inside of the cheek. this sign is specific of measles infection, but may be absent at the time of examination. observation of koplik's spots is not required for diagnosing measles. eruptive phase (4 to 6 days) on average 3 days after the onset of symptoms: eruption of erythematous, non- pruritic maculopapules, which blanch with pressure. the rash begins on the forehead then spreads downward to the face, neck, trunk (second day), abdomen and lower limbs (third and fourth day). as the rash progresses, prodromal symptoms subside. in the absence of complications, the fever disappears once the rash reaches the feet. the rash fades around the fifth day in the same order that it appeared (from the head to the feet). the eruptive phase is followed by skin desquamation during 1 to 2 weeks, very pronounced on pigmented skin (the skin develops a striped appearance). in practice, a patient presenting with fever and erythematous maculopapular rash and at least one of the following signs: cough or runny nose or conjunctivitis, is a clinical case of measles. complications most measles cases experience at least one complication: respiratory and ent: pneumonia, otitis media, laryngotracheobronchitis ocular: purulent conjunctivitis, keratitis, xerophthalmia (risk of blindness) gastrointestinal: diarrhoea with or without dehydration, benign or severe stomatitis neurological: febrile seizures; rarely, encephalitis acute malnutrition, provoked or aggravated by measles (post-measles period) pneumonia and dehydration are the most common immediate causes of death. case management admit as inpatient children with at least one major complication: inability to eat/drink/suck, or vomiting altered consciousness or seizures dehydration severe pneumonia (pneumonia with respiratory distress or cyanosis or spo < 90%) 2 acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) a corneal lesions (pain, photophobia, erosion or opacity) page 25 2/ 409severe

purulent conjunctivitis (no corneal lesions) diarrhoea without dehydration oral candidiasis that does not interfere with eating if in doubt, keep the child under observation for a few hours. isolation isolation of hospitalized patients measles cases treated as outpatients should be kept at home during this period. treatment supportive and preventive treatment treat fever: paracetamol (fever, chapter 1). make the child drink (high risk of dehydration). give smaller, more frequent meals or breastfeed more frequently (every 2 to 3 hours). clear the nasopharynx (nose-blowing or nasal lavages) to prevent secondary respiratory infection and improve the child’s comfort. clean the eyes with clean water 2 times daily and administer retinol on d1 and d2 (see xerophthalmia, chapter 5) to prevent ocular complications. in children under 5 years: amoxicillin po for 5 days as a preventive measure (reduction of respiratory and ocular infections). in the event of watery diarrhoea without dehydration: oral rehydration according to who plan a (see dehydration, chapter 1). insert a nasogastric tube for a few days if oral lesions prevent the child from drinking. treatment of complications page 25 3/ 409treatment of complications severe pneumonia ceftriaxone iv or im + cloxacillin iv then change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po (see chapter 2) + oxygen if cyanosis or spo < 90% 2 + salbutamol if expiratory wheezing and sibilant rales on auscultation in all cases, close monitoring. pneumonia without severe amoxicillin po for 5 days signs croup inpatient monitoring (risk of worsening). keep the child calm. agitation and crying exacerbate the symptoms. for severe croup: dexamethasone im: 0.6 mg/kg single dose + nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline, 1 mg/ml ampoule): 0.5

febrile seizures see seizures, chapter 1. prevention no chemoprophylaxis for contacts. vaccination: between 9 and 12 months: one dose of 0.5 ml. the who recommends a second dose between 15 and 18 months. respect an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. where there is high risk of infection (overcrowding, epidemics, malnutrition, infants born to a mother with hiv infection, etc.), administer a supplementary dose from 6 months of age then continue vaccination schedule. children under 15 years who have missed either one or both doses of routine vaccination should be vaccinated when they come in contact with health services. check national recommendations. page 25 4/ 409footnotes (a) symptoms (hoarse crying or voice, difficulty breathing, a high-pitched inspiratory wheeze [inspiratory stridor], characteristic "barking" cough) are caused by inflammation and narrowing of the larynx. croup is considered benign or “moderate” if the stridor occurs when the child is agitated or crying, but disappears when the child is calm. the child should be monitored during this period, however, because his general and respiratory status can deteriorate rapidly. croup is severe when the stridor persists at rest or is associated with signs of respiratory distress. page 25 5/ 409poliomyelitis poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection due to a poliovirus (serotypes 1, 2 or 3). human-to-human transmission is direct (faecal-oral) or indirect (ingestion of food and water contaminated by stool). humans are the only reservoir of the virus. in principle the disease can be eradicated by mass vaccination. in endemic areas, poliomyelitis mainly affect children under 5 years not (or not fully) vaccinated, but the infection can affect persons of any age, especially in areas where population immunity is low. clinical features up to 90% of cases are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms [1] . non-paralytic form: a non-specific febrile illness with muscle pain, headache, vomiting, backache; no neurological involvement. as spontaneous recovery usually occurs within 10 days, diagnosis is rarely made outside epidemic contexts. paralytic form: in less than 1% of cases, after the non-specific signs, the patient develops rapid onset (from the morning to the evening) asymmetrical acute flaccid paralysis, predominantly of the lower limbs, with ascending progression. the muscles become soft with diminished reflexes. sensation is maintained. the disease is life threatening if paralysis involves the respiratory muscles or muscles of swallowing. initial urinary retention is common. gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), muscle pain and meningeal symptoms may also occur. laboratory look for the polio virus in stool samples. the virus is excreted for one month after infection, but only intermittently; therefore, 2 samples must be collected with an interval of 24-48 hours, and within 14 days of onset of symptoms [2] . send the stool samples to a reference laboratory, with a clinical description of the patient. the stool samples must be stored and transported between 0 °c and 8 °c. treatment hospitalise patients with the paralytic form: rest, prevent bed sores in bedridden patients, give analgesics (do not give im injections to patients in the febrile phase), ventilate patients with respiratory paralysis. physiotherapy once the lesions are stable to prevent muscle atrophy and contractures. care for sequelae: physiotherapy, surgery and prosthetics. outbreak control in case of acute flaccid paralysis (afp) consider any patient with afp as a suspected case of poliomyelitis. send stool samples to a reference laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. organize vaccination of all children under 5 years living in the area (from the same village or neighbouring villages) irrespective of their vaccination status, within 14 days of laboratory confirmation and with the available vaccine (round 0) [3] . organize two mass vaccination campaigns within 8 weeks of the laboratory confirmation. the type of vaccine, the area and the age groups are determined by epidemiological data. organize a mop-up (door-to-door) vaccination campaign wherever monitoring suggests that children have been missed, to ensure interruption of transmission. surveillance: for each case of afp there are between 100 and 200 subclinical cases. therefore, active surveillance to detect new cases is essential for epidemic control. page 25 6/ 409prevention 3 types of vaccines exist: a trivalent injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (ipv), a bivalent oral live attenuated poliovirus vaccine (bopv), containing serotypes 1 and 3, a monovalent oral type 2 vaccine (mopv or nopv) exclusively used for responding to epidemics. vaccination schedule: depends on the epidemiology of the virus. protocols vary according to the country, follow national recommendations. for information, the who recommends: primary vaccination schedule endemic or at risk zones (a) other zones birth 1 dose bopv (b) – 6 weeks 1 dose bopv 1 dose bopv 10 weeks 1 dose bopv 1 dose bopv 14 weeks 1 dose bopv + 1 dose ipv 1 dose bopv + 1 dose ipv (a) countries where poliomyelitis is endemic or zones at high risk of importation and subsequent spread of the virus. (b) the first dose of bopv is administered at birth, or as soon as possible, to optimise seroconversion rates after subsequent doses and induce mucosal protection. in children who start routine vaccination late (after the age of 3 months), the dose of ipv is administered together with the first dose of bopv, followed by 2 doses of bopv alone administered 4 weeks apart. there is also an ‘ipv only’ schedule: 3 doses administered at least 4 weeks apart (e.g. at 6, 10 and 14 weeks) and a booster dose at least 6 months later. ipv should eventually completely replace bopv. references 1. world health organization. poliomyelitis (polio). https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1 [accessed 08 june 2021] 2. centers for disease control and prevention. poliomyelitis. 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html [accessed 08 june 2021] 3. global polio eradication initiative. standard operating procedures: responding to a poliovirus event or outbreak, version 3.1. world health organization. 2020. https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240002999 [accessed 08 june 2021] page 25 7/ 409rabies rabies is a viral infection of wild and domestic mammals, transmitted to humans by the saliva of infected animals through bites, scratches or licks on broken skin or mucous membranes. in endemic areas (africa and asia), 99% of cases are due to dog bites and 40% of cases are children under 15 years of age [1] . before symptoms develop, rabies can effectively be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis. once symptoms develop, rabies is fatal. there is no curative treatment; care is palliative. clinical features the incubation period averages 20 to 90 days from exposure (75% of patients), but can be shorter (in severe exposure, e.g. bites to face, head and hands; multiple bites), or longer (20% of patients develop symptoms between 90 days and 1 year, and 5% more than 1 year after exposure). prodromal phase: itching or paraesthesiae or neuropathic pain around the site of exposure, and non-specific symptoms (fever, malaise, etc.). neurologic phase: encephalitic form (furious form): psychomotor agitation or hydrophobia (throat spasms and panic, triggered by attempting to drink or sight/sound/touch of water) and aerophobia (similar response to a draft of air); sometimes seizures. the patient is calm and lucid between episodes. infection evolves to paralysis and coma. paralytic form (less common, 20% of cases): progressive ascending paralysis resembling guillain-barré syndrome; evolves to coma. diagnosis is often difficult: there may be no history of scratch or bite (exposure through licking) or wounds may have healed; a reliable history may be difficult to obtain. post-exposure prophylaxis definitions of exposure categories (who) category i contact with animal, or licks on intact skin no exposure nibbles on exposed skin category ii minor exposure minor bite(s) or scratch(es) without bleeding transdermal bite(s) or scratch(es) licks on broken skin category iii severe exposure contamination of mucous membranes by animal’s saliva (licks) direct contact with bats a post-exposure prophylaxis is carried out for category ii and iii exposures. treatment of the wound in all cases page 25 8/ 409prolonged cleansing of the wound or contact site for 15 minutes to eliminate the virus, as soon as possible after exposure, is of critical importance. for skin: use soap, rinse copiously with running water, remove all foreign material; application of a disinfectant (povidone iodine 10% or other) is an additional precaution which does not take the place of thorough wound washing. for mucous membranes (eye, mouth, etc.): rinse thoroughly with water or 0.9% sodium chloride. local cleansing is indicated even if the patient presents late. according to condition/type of wound in order to avoid inoculating virus deeper into the tissues, wounds are either not sutured at all (e.g. superficial, non- mutilating or puncture wounds), or are left open and re-evaluated in 48-72 hours, with a view to possible closure. highly contaminated wounds, or wounds that may compromise function, require surgical management (exploration, removal of foreign material, excision of necrotic tissue, copious irrigation with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or ringer lactate, with local or general anaesthesia). when suturing is indicated (face), rabies immunoglobulin should be administered several hours before wound closure (see below). infected wounds are not sutured and reassessed daily. passive and active immunisation given the duration of incubation, administration of vaccine/immunoglobulin is always a priority, even for patients exposed several months previously. anti-rabies serotherapy rabies immunoglobulin is indicated after: category iii exposures (except in patients who have received a full course of pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies, see prevention); category ii and iii exposures in immunocompromised patients b (even in patients who have received a full course of pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies). it is intended to neutralize virus in the exposure site. it is given as a single dose on d0, with the first dose of rabies vaccine. human rabies immunoglobulin: children and adults: 20 iu/kg or highly purified rabies immunoglobulin f(ab')2 fragments: children and adults: 40 iu/kg infiltrate rabies immunoglobulin into and around the previously washed wound(s). ensure it is not injected into a blood vessel (risk of shock). for finger wounds, infiltrate very cautiously to avoid increased pressure in the tissue compartment (compartment syndrome). in the event of multiple wounds, dilute the dose 2- to 3-fold with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain a sufficient quantity to infiltrate all the sites exposed. infiltrate rabies immunoglobulin into the wound even if it has already healed. for mucosal exposures with no wound, rinse with rabies immunoglobulin diluted in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride. monitor the patient during and after the injection (low risk of anaphylactic reaction). if rabies immunoglobulin is not available on d0, the first dose of rabies vaccine is administered alone. administer rabies immunoglobulin as soon as possible between d0 and d7; from d8, it is not necessary to administer rabies immunoglobulin as vaccine-induced antibodies begin to appear. [1] post-exposure rabies prophylaxis page 25 9/ 409a complete prophylaxis series is indicated for category ii and iii exposures. it should be started on d0 and continued to completion if the risk of rabies has not been excluded c . several different types of rabies vaccines prepared from cell cultures (cceev) exist. these vaccines must replace nerve tissue vaccines (ntv). prophylaxis schedules may vary from country to country, check national recommendations. the patient must be administered the full course of doses indicated. main post-exposure prophylaxis regimens [1] no pre-exposure prophylaxis or unknown prophylaxis status or incomplete pre-exposure prophylaxis or complete pre-exposure prophylaxis with an ntv date im route (a) id route (b) 1 dose = 0.5 or 1 ml depending on the 1 dose = 0.1 ml manufacturer 2 doses (c) 2 doses (c) d0 1 dose (c) (1 dose in each arm or thigh) (1 dose in each arm) 2 doses d3 1 dose (1 dose in each arm) 2 doses d7 1 dose 1 dose (1 dose in each arm) d14 1 dose (d) d21 1 dose (a) im route: there are two possible schedules, the zagreb regimen (2-0-1-0-1) over 21 days or the 4-dose essen regimen (1-1- 1-1-0) over 14 to 28 days. the im injection is administered into the anterolateral part of the thigh in children < 2 years; into the deltoid muscle (arm) in children ≥ 2 years and adults; do not administer into the gluteal muscle. (b) id route: inject into the deltoid muscle (or the suprascapular region or the anterolateral part of the thigh). incorrect id technique results in failure of post-exposure prophylaxis. if correct id technique cannot be assured, use im route. (c) as well as a single dose of rabies immunoglobulin on d0 if indicated. (d) the last injection can be administered between d14 and d28. notes: in immunocompromised patients: 1 dose on d0, 1 dose on d7 and 1 dose between d21 and d28. [1] in patients that have received a full course of pre-exposure prophylaxis (see prevention), the post-exposure regimen is: 1 dose on d0 and 1 dose d3 by im or id route or 4 doses by id route on d0. other measures antibiotherapy/antibiotic prophylaxis [2] page 26 0/ 409infection present no infection no infection and and local: redness, wounds on the face or hands or no criteria requiring antibiotic oedema, serosanguinous genital region prophylaxis or purulent drainage wounds involving joint, tendon, wounds more than 24-48 locoregional or general: ligament or fracture hours old lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, deep puncture wounds localised cellulitis, bone or joint wounds with crush injury infection, fever wounds very contaminated or requiring debridement wounds where correct debridement is not possible immunocompromised patients antibiotherapy po 7 days in the event antibiotic prophylaxis po 5 to 7 days no antibiotic prophylaxis of local non severe infection; 14 days in the event of severe local infection, or widespread generalised infection. the same dosage is used for both treatment and prophylaxis: the treatment of choice is amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) po d use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1. the dose is expressed in amoxicillin: children < 40 kg: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily children ≥ 40 kg and adults: ratio 8:1: 2000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 2 times daily) ratio 7:1: 1750 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 2 times daily) tetanus vaccination and serotherapy check prophylaxis status. if unknown or not up-to-date, see tetanus, chapter 7. prevention pre-exposure prophylaxis with a cceev for people at risk (prolonged stay in rabies endemic areas, professionals in contact with animals susceptible of carrying the virus, etc): 1 dose by im route or 2 doses by id route on d0 and d7. footnotes (a) in the event of direct contact with bats, check national recommendations.

409viral hepatitis last updated: october 2021 several viral infections of the liver are grouped under the heading of viral hepatitis: hepatitis a, b, c, d (delta) and e. the different hepatitis viruses are present throughout the world, but their prevalence varies by country. hepatitis a and b are common in developing countries where the vast majority of infections occur during childhood. the clinical characteristics of all five diseases are similar enough to make differential diagnosis difficult; however, there are epidemiological, immunological and pathological differences. patients with hepatitis b, c and d may later develop chronic liver disease. the main characteristics of each type of viral hepatitis are summarized in the table below. clinical features asymptomatic forms mild or anicteric forms are the most common, irrespective of the causal virus. icteric forms insidious or sudden onset with symptoms of varying intensity: fever, fatigue, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbance, followed by jaundice, dark coloured urine and more or less claycoloured stool. fulminant forms hepatocellular failure with severe cytolysis that can be fatal. this form is most frequent in hepatitis b patients with secondary infection with the d virus, and in the event of pregnant women infected with hepatitis e during their third trimester. chronic hepatitis hepatitis b, c and d may lead to

humans by the bite of a mosquito (aedes). transmission by transfusion of contaminated blood and transplacental transmission to the foetus have also been reported. four different serotypes of dengue have been described. infection with one serotype provides a lifelong immunity to that specific serotype, but only partial, short-term immunity to other serotypes. there is no specific antiviral treatment. dengue is a mainly urban disease, present in tropical and subtropical regions a , in particular in asia, central and south america and the caribbean. outbreaks have been described in eastern africa. primary infection may be asymptomatic or present as mild or occasionally severe dengue fever. subsequent infections increase the risk of severe dengue. clinical features after the incubation period (4 to 10 days), the illness occurs in 3 phases: febrile phase: high fever (39 to 40 °c) lasting 2 to 7 days, often accompanied by generalized aches, a maculopapular rash and mild haemorrhagic manifestations. critical phase (between the third and seventh day): at the end of the febrile phase, temperature decreases. the majority of patients will have dengue without warning signs and proceed to the recovery phase. certain patients will develop dengue with warning sign(s) at this stage. these patients are at higher risk for developing severe dengue. recovery phase: patient improves, vital signs normalise, gastrointestinal symptoms subside and appetite returns. at times, bradycardia and generalized pruritus. page 26 8/ 409symptoms according to severity (adapted from paho [1] ) dengue fever + 2 of the following symptoms: without warning nausea, vomiting signs rash resembling measles generalized aches (headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, arthralgias) benign mucocutaneous bleeding (petechiae, positive tourniquet test (a) , epistaxis, gingival bleeding) leucopenia dengue presence of at least one of these symptoms: with warning signs intense abdominal pain persistent vomiting fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion) mucosal bleeding hepatomegaly (> 2 cm) postural hypotension agitation or lethargy increasing haematocrit severe dengue severe fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion) with respiratory distress and/or shock severe mucocutaneous bleeding severe organ involvement (e.g.: transaminases > 1000 iu/litre, myocarditis, altered mental status) (a) tourniquet test: inflate a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to a point midway between the systolic and diastolic pressure for 5 min. the test is positive when 20 or more petechiae per 2.5 cm square are observed. major differential diagnoses other conditions to consider include a wide range of acute febrile illnesses, e.g.: chikungunya, zika, influenza, mononucleosis, measles, rubella, viral haemorrhagic fevers malaria meningococcemia, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsioses, other causes of sepsis leukaemia laboratory diagnosis ns-1 antigen detection during febrile phase with rapid diagnostic test or elisa (serum, plasma or blood). antibody detection (complex interpretation): igm detection 5 to 6 days after onset of illness may support (but does not confirm) a diagnosis of recent infection; igg detection may indicate prior infection by, or vaccination against, dengue virus or a closely related virus (e.g. chikungunya, zika, japanese encephalitis, yellow fever). pcr may also be available in reference laboratories. in all cases, rapid test for malaria in endemic regions (and antimalarial treatment if needed, see malaria, chapter 6). page 26 9/ 409monitoring disease course haematocrit (hct) or if available full blood count (fbc) at baseline, then daily if possible. a progressive increase in hct is a warning sign. it indicates haemoconcentration due to increased vascular permeability (plasma leakage). hct should be monitored frequently (before and after fluid administration) in patients with warning signs up to the end of the fluid treatment. leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common and improve as the recovery phase begins. leukocytosis may occur with severe bleeding. liver function tests if possible at baseline, then according to results. treatment patients in group a (outpatients) patients with no warning signs, able to drink sufficiently and with a normal urine output. bed rest and good hydration. fever and pain: paracetamol po at the usual doses (see fever, chapter 1), maintaining a 6 to 8 hour interval between doses. do not prescribe acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen or other nsaids. seek medical attention if: no clinical improvement, persistent vomiting, cold extremities, agitation or lethargy, breathing difficulties or absence of urine output. if follow-up is impossible or symptoms cannot be monitored at home (patients living far from the health care facility/living alone), hospitalise for observation. patients in group b (inpatients) patients with any of the following: warning sign(s) acute (e.g. severe dehydation or malaria) or chronic (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular, renal or haemolytic disease, obesity) co-morbidities risk factors for bleeding (e.g. anticoagulation, coagulopathy, peptic ulcer or gastritis, treatment with nsaids) pregnant women, patients under 1 year or 65 years and over or patients with difficulty drinking in all cases: place the patient under a mosquito net; encourage oral fluid intake (including oral rehydration solution (ors) if needed). avoid invasive procedures (nasogastric tube, im injections) to minimize the risk of bleeding. fever and pain: paracetamol po [2] with caution and without exceeding: children: 10 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours adults: 500 mg every 6 to 8 hours in case of elevated transaminases ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal, do not administer paracetamol. use tepid sponging for reducing fever. monitor vital signs, fluid intake (infusion and oral) and urine output every 4 hours b . if poor oral intake: place an intravenous line and administer: children: 5% glucose + ringer lactate solution c as maintenance fluids, according to the holliday-segar formula, i.e. 4 ml/kg/hour for first 10 kg of body weight + 2 ml/kg/hour for next 10 kg + 1 ml/kg/hour for each additional kg above 20 kg. adults: ringer lactate, 2 to 3 ml/kg/hour encourage oral intake as soon as possible. if warning signs: page 27 0/ 409monitor clinical status (warning signs, general symptoms, vital signs, capillary refill time), iv and oral fluid intake, urine output, hourly for at least 4 hours, then every 4 hours while the patient is on iv fluid treatment. place an intravenous line and administer a bolus of ringer lactate: children and adults: 10 ml/kg over one hour patients 65 years and over or with co-morbidities : 5 ml/kg over one hour re-assess the patient: if no improvement after first bolus: administer a second bolus as above. if necessary, a total of 3 boluses can be administered. if still no improvement after 3 bolus, consider as severe dengue (patients in group c) and transfer to intensive care unit. if improvement after the first, second, or third bolus, reduce ringer lactate: children and adults: 5 to 7 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours patients 65 years and over or with co-morbidities: 5 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours if continuing improvement, reduce ringer lactate (then stop as soon as possible to reduce the risk of fluid overload): children and adults: 3 to 5 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours, then 2 to 4 ml/kg/hour over 24 to 48 hours patients 65 years and over or with co-morbidities: 3 ml/kg/hour over 2 to 4 hours, then 2 ml/kg/hour over 24 to 48 hours if the patient deteriorates after initial improvement, resume the bolus therapy with ringer lactate (up to 3 bolus) as above. patients in group c (intensive care unit) patients with severe dengue requiring emergency treatment for managing shock and other complications (e.g. severe bleeding, acidosis, coagulopathy). prevention individual protection: long sleeves and

restrict visitors (if a carer is strictly necessary, s/he must be protected with gown, gloves, mask). standard precautions: the majority of hospital-acquired infections have occurred due to a lack of respect for these precautions: hand washing; gloves for patient examination and when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin; gowns to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing during consultations and activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions; surgical mask and goggles, or face shield, to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during activities that may generate splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions; adequate procedures for the routine cleaning and disinfection of objects and surfaces; rubber gloves to handle soiled laundry; safe waste management; safe injection practices. confirmed cases of ebola, marburg, lassa, crimean-congo fevers or epidemics of unknown origin strict isolation in a reserved area separate from other patient areas, with a defined circuit for entrance/exit and changing room at the entrance/exit;

[1] laboratory diagnosis of hiv infection the diagnosis is made with serological (detection of antibodies against the virus) or virological (especially in infants) testing. testing should always be done voluntarily with informed consent. all hiv test results must be strictly confidential in order to avoid discrimination. the individual should have access to services offering pre-test and post-test counselling, treatment and support. a diagnosis of hiv infection can be made only after at least 2 different test results (2 different brands) are clearly positive: the positive result of an initial (highly sensitive) test must be confirmed through use of a second (highly specific) test. in areas where hiv prevalence is low, diagnosis is confirmed after 3 positive test results. cd4 lymphocyte counts cd4 cell depletion is a marker of the progression of immune depression. the level of the cd4 cell count is a predictor of the development of opportunistic infections or neoplasms and can be used to orient their diagnosis, e.g. cerebral toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis appear when the cd4 count is below 100 cells/mm3 in adults. if clinical symptoms/signs are present suggesting one of these infections, but the cd4 count is greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3, it is unlikely that that particular infection is present. opportunistic infections page 27 7/ 409it is important to screen for serious opportunistic infections in those at risk (e.g. testing for cryptococcal antigen for all adults with a cd4 count < 100 cells/mm3 regardless of symptoms). treatment of hiv infection antiretroviral (arv) treatment a a multi-drug (at least 3) antiretroviral therapy (art) is the reference treatment. it does not eradicate the virus, but slows the progression of the disease and improves the patient’s clinical state by reducing viral replication and consequently increasing the cd4 cell count to levels beyond the threshold of opportunistic infections. therapeutic classes four major classes arv are used: nrti (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors): zidovudine (azt), lamivudine (3tc), abacavir (abc), tenofovir (tdf), emtricitabine (ftc). nnrti (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors): efavirenz (efv), nevirapine (nvp), etravirine (etr). hiv-2 is naturally resistant to nnrtis. pi (protease inhibitors): atazanavir (atv), lopinavir (lpv), ritonavir (rtv), darunavir (drv). ini (integrase inhibitors): dolutegravir, raltegravir. principles of arv treatment daily triple therapy must be taken for life to prevent the rapid development of resistance. it is important that the patient understands this and that adherence to treatment is optimal. follow the art protocols recommended by national hiv program. the most widely used and easiest regimens to administer are 2 nrti + 1 nnrti: e.g. tdf/3tc/efv. in the event of treatment failure, all 3 drugs should be replaced with a second-line regimen: 2 other nrtis + 1 pi. other possible combinations exist which are less commonly used or more difficult to manage. criteria for arv treatment as a priority art should be initiated in all patients with who clinical stage 3 or 4 and patients with cd4 < 350 /mm3. however, those with higher cd4 counts can initiate art. monitoring of arv treatment hiv viral load is an essential tool for monitoring the effectiveness of arv. cd4 count is useful for identifying severely immunosuppressed. other tests such as blood count, tests for liver (alat) and renal function (creatinine clearance) are not essential, but can be useful in detecting adverse effects. treatment of opportunistic and other infections with progressive immunosuppression, hiv-infected patients who are not receiving triple therapy (or patients on art but with poor adherence) become increasingly susceptible to infections. for conditions of clinical stages 2 and 3, standard treatments are usually effective. patients may benefit from primary prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (see primary prophylaxis). tuberculosis (tb) is the most common serious opportunistic infection. it can be difficult to diagnose in hiv-infected patients however. treatment of pain treat all patients for associated pain (see pain, chapter 1). prevention of hiv infection page 27 8/ 409sexual transmission the most reliable method of prevention is the use of male or female condoms. male circumcision decreases significantly the risk of hiv transmission. early diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections is essential as they increase the transmission of hiv (see chapter 9). art to hiv positive and adherent partner does protect the negative partner from hiv infection. occupational transmission (accidental needle stick injuries or injuries with contaminated objects, contact between a patient’s blood and unprotected broken skin or mucous membranes) prevention is based on use of standard precautions to avoid contamination with soiled material or potentially infected body fluids. post-exposure prophylaxis (pep): e.g. in the event of rape or occupational accidental exposure to blood, arv treatment initiated as soon as possible within 72 hours of exposure for a duration of 1 month may reduce the risk of infection. nosocomial transmission prevention of nosocomial hiv infection is based on the rational use of injections and strict respect for hygiene and sterilization and disinfection procedures for medical material. for transfusion: strict respect of indications for transfusion and systematic serological screening of the donor’s blood are the two indispensable precautions in the prevention of hiv transmission through transfusions. transmission in injection drug users needle and syringe exchange programs with disposable needles and syringes for users can reduce the risk. mother-to-child transmission (mtct) the global rate of vertical transmission varies from 20 to 40%. the risk of transmission through breast-feeding is evaluated at approximately 12% and persists for the duration of breast-feeding. in pregnant women: hiv transmission from mother-to-child may be reduced by art. the protocol called option b+ is the internationally preferred protocol. all hiv-infected pregnant women receive lifelong triple-drug therapy, regardless of the cd4 count or clinical stage, both for their own health and to prevent transmission to the child. the most commonly recommended art is tdf/3tc/efv or tdf/ftc/efv. check national recommendations. in addition, arvs are administered to the newborn. programs targeting pregnant women also include other preventive measures such as avoiding artificial rupture of the membranes and systematic episiotomy. in breast-feeding women: exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months of life, introduction of complementary (solid) foods at 6 months, gradual cessation of breast-feeding to the age of 12 months. prevention of opportunistic infections in the absence of arv treatment, all hiv-infected individuals become symptomatic and evolve towards aids. however, some opportunistic infections can be prevented. primary prophylaxis for

responds to corticosteroids. secondary ns is associated with infectious diseases (e.g. post-infectious glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, hepatitis b and c, hiv infection, malaria, and schistosomiasis) and may respond to treatment of the underlying cause. children with ns are at increased risk of thromboembolism, severe bacterial infections (in particular, due to s. pneumoniae) and malnutrition. untreated ns may progress to renal failure. clinical features typically, the child presents with soft, pitting and painless oedema, which varies in location based on position and activity. upon awaking, the child has periorbital or facial oedema, which over the day decreases as oedema of the legs increases. as oedema worsens, it may localize to the back or genitals, or become generalized with ascites and pleural effusions. this oedema should be differentiated from the oedema of severe acute malnutrition (sam): in sam, the child presents with bilateral pitting oedema of the feet and lower legs that does not vary with position. oedema extends upwards to hands and face in severe cases. it is usually associated with typical skin and hair changes (see kwashiorkor: severe acute malnutrition, chapter 1). once sam is excluded, the following two criteria must be met to make a clinical diagnosis of primary ns: presence of heavy proteinuria, and absence of associated infections: see hepatitis b and c and hiv infection (chapter 8), malaria and schistosomiases (chapter 6). laboratory urine measure protein with urinary dipstick on three separate voided urine samples (first voided urine if possible). in ns, proteinuria is equal or greater than +++ or equal or greater than 300 mg/dl or 30 g/litre a . ns is excluded if heavy proteinuria is not consistently present. in case of macroscopic haematuria, or microscopic haematuria ≥ +, consider glomerulonephritis. blood tests (if available) serum albumin concentration less than 30 g/litre and hyperlipidaemia. blood urea nitrogen (bun) and creatinine most often in the normal range. perform all necessary laboratory tests to exclude secondary ns. treatment hospitalize the child for initial therapy. corticosteroids (prednisolone or prednisone) are indicated in primary ns. before starting corticosteroid treatment: treat any concomitant acute infections such as pneumonia, peritonitis, sepsis, pharyngitis, or cellulitis. page 29 5/ 409exclude active tuberculosis and/or start antituberculous treatment. corticosteroid treatment see algorithm below. total length of initial treatment is 2 to 4 months. nutrition, fluid intake, nursing and follow-up no salt-added diet. do not restrict fluids (risk of thrombosis due to hypercoagulability). if oedema is very severe, fluids may initially be restricted (e.g. 75% of usual intake) while monitoring urine output. encourage child to walk and play to prevent thromboembolism. discharge child when stable, follow-up at least monthly, more frequently if indicated, weight and urine dipstick at each visit. instruct the parent to continue no salt-added diet and to seek medical advice in case of fever, abdominal pain, respiratory distress or signs of thromboembolism. management of infections treat infections as soon as they appear but do not routinely give prophylactic antibiotics. immunization children under 5 years: check that the child has received all epi vaccines including haemophilus influenzae type b, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine and (if in an endemic area) meningococcal a conjugate vaccine. if not, administer catch-up vaccines. children over 5 years: check that the child has received tetanus, measles, pneumococcal conjugate and (if in an endemic area) meningococcal a conjugate vaccine. if not, administer catch-up vaccines. management of complications intravascular volume depletion potentially leading to shock, present despite oedematous appearance page 29 6/ 409signs include decreased urine output with any one of the following: capillary refill ≥ 3 seconds, poor skin perfusion/mottling, cold extremities, low blood pressure. if signs are present, administer human albumin 5% iv: 1 g/kg. if albumin is not available, administer ringer lactate or 0.9% sodium chloride: 10 ml/kg over 30 minutes. if signs of shock are present, see shock, chapter 1. respiratory distress due to severe oedema (rare) this is the only situation in which diuretics should be used and only if there are no signs of intravascular volume depletion or after hypovolaemia has been corrected: furosemide po: 0.5 mg/kg 2 times daily if not effective, discontinue furosemide. if creatinine is normal, administer spironolactone po: 1 mg/kg 2 times daily. the dose can be increased to 9 mg/kg daily in resistant cases of ascites. while on diuretics, monitor for dehydration, thromboembolism and hypokalaemia. specialized advice and management (including further investigations such as renal biopsy) are required: in children less than 1 year or more than 10 years, in case of steroid resistant ns, in case of mixed nephrotic and nephritic clinical picture. in case of steroid-resistant ns, when referral is impossible and as a last resort, the following palliative measure may reduce proteinuria and delay renal failure: enalapril po: 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg 2 times daily (start with the lowest dose and increase gradually if necessary until reduction of proteinuria). if available, monitor for hyperkalaemia. this is a palliative measure and the prognosis for steroid-resistant ns is poor in the absence of specialized treatment. footnotes (a) nephrotic range proteinuria in children is defined as urinary protein excretion greater than 50 mg/kg daily. quantitative measurement of protein excretion is normally based on a timed 24-hour urine collection. however, if this test cannot be performed, urine dipstick measurements can be substituted. page 29 7/ 409urolithiasis last updated: december 2020 urolithiasis is the formation and passage of calculi (stones) in the urinary tract. clinical features many calculi do not cause symptoms; they may be found incidentally through radiology exams. symptoms arise when calculi cause partial or complete obstruction and/or infection: intermittent, acute flank to pelvic pain (renal colic). pain can be severe and typically causes nausea and vomiting. abdomen/flank may be tender to palpation. patients are typically restless, finding no comfortable position. haematuria and/or gravel (calculi) passed in urine. fever and signs of pyelonephritis if secondary infection develops (see acute pyelonephritis, chapter 9). note: if available, ultrasound may demonstrate calculi and hydronephrosis. treatment encourage the patient to drink fluids. administer analgesics according to the intensity of pain (see pain, chapter 1). in case of secondary infection: antibiotic treatment as for pyelonephritis. the effectiveness will depend on the passage of calculi. note: the majority of calculi pass spontaneously. if there are signs of significant renal dysfunction or secondary infection that does not improve with antibiotic treatment, consider surgical referral. page 29 8/ 409acute cystitis last updated: july 2021 cystitis is an infection of the bladder and urethra that affects mainly women and girls from 2 years of age. escherichia coli is the causative pathogen in at least 70% of cases. other pathogens include proteus mirabilis, enterococcus sp, klebsiella sp and in young women, staphylococcus saprophyticus. clinical features burning pain on urination and urinary urgency and frequency; in children: crying when passing urine; involuntary loss of urine. and no fever (or mild fever), no flank pain; no systemic signs and symptoms in children. it is essential to rule out pyelonephritis. the symptom 'burning pain on urination' alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis. see abnormal vaginal discharge. investigations urine dipstick test: perform dipstick analysis for nitrites (which indicate the presence of enterobacteria) and leukocytes (which indicate an inflammation) in the urine. if dipstick analysis is positive for nitrites and/or leukocytes, a urinary infection is likely. in women, if dipstick analysis is negative for both nitrites and leukocytes, a urinary infection is excluded. microscopy/culture: when a dipstick analysis is positive, it is recommended to carry out urine microscopy/culture in order to confirm the infection and identify the causative pathogen, particularly in children and pregnant women. when urine microscopy is not feasible, an empirical antibiotherapy should be administered to patients with typical signs of cystitis and positive dipstick urinalysis (leukocytes and/or nitrites). note: aside of these results, in areas where urinary schistosomiasis is endemic, consider schistosomiasis in patients with macroscopic haematuria or microscopic haematuria detected by dipstick test, especially in children from 5 to 15 years, even if the patient may suffer from concomitant bacterial cystitis. pocus a : in cases of recurrent cystitis, perform fast views to evaluate for signs of urinary tract pathologies. treatment cystitis in girls ≥ 2 years cefixime po: 8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po (dose expressed in amoxicillin): 12.5 mg/kg 2 times daily for 3 days cystitis in young, nonpregnant women if dipstick analysis is positive for both nitrites and leukocytes: fosfomycin-trometamol po: 3 g single dose or nitrofurantoin po: 100 mg 3 times daily for 5 days page 29 9/ 409if dipstick analysis is negative for nitrites but positive for leukocytes, the infection may be due to s. saprophyticus. fosfomycin is not active against this pathogen. use nitrofurantoin as above. whatever the antibiotic used, symptoms may persist for 2 to 3 days despite adequate treatment. in the event of treatment failure (or recurrent cystitis i.e. > 3-4 episodes per year), ciprofloxacin po: 500 mg 2 times daily for 3 days for patients with recurrent cystitis, consider bladder stones, urinary schistosomiasis, urinary tuberculosis or gonorrhoea (examine the partner). cystitis in pregnant or lactating women fosfomycin-trometamol po: 3 g single dose or nitrofurantoin po (contraindicated in the last month of pregnancy): 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days or cefixime po: 200 mg 2 times daily for 5 days footnotes (a) pocus should only be performed and interpreted by trained clinicians. page 30 0/ 409acute pyelonephritis pyelonephritis is an infection of the renal parenchyma, more common in women than in men. the pathogens causing pyelonephritis are the same as those causing cystitis (see acute cystitis, chapter 9). pyelonephritis is potentially severe, especially in pregnant women, neonates and infants. management depends on the presence of signs of severity or complications or risk of complications. clinical features neonates and infant symptoms are not specific: fever, irritability, vomiting, poor oral intake. palpation of the lower abdomen may show abdominal tenderness. the absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis. on the other hand, fever –with no obvious cause– may be the only manifestation. neonates may present with fever or hypothermia, altered general condition, altered conscious state, pale/grey colour, shock. in practice, a urinary tract infection should be suspected in children with unexplained fever or septic syndrome with no obvious focus of infection. older children and adults signs of cystitis (burning pain on urination and urinary urgency and frequency, etc.) and fever > 38 °c and unilateral flank pain or abdominal tenderness nausea and/or vomiting are common. laboratory see acute cystitis, chapter 9. treatment criteria for hospital admission: patients at risk of complications: children, pregnant women, men a , functional or structural abnormality of the urinary tract (lithiasis, malformation, etc.), severe immunodeficiency; patients with complicated pyelonephritis: urinary tract obstruction, renal abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis in diabetic patients; patients with signs of severe infection: sepsis (infection with signs of organ dysfunction) and septic shock, dehydration or nausea/vomiting preventing hydration and oral treatment; no clinical improvement 24 hours after the start of oral antibiotherapy in women treated as outpatients. antibiotherapy in children children under one month ampicillin slow iv (3 minutes) for 7 to 10 days children 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 50 mg/kg

least 3 days + gentamicin im: 5 mg/kg once daily for 3 days then change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po (or another antibiotic depending on the antibiotic susceptibility test) to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment or ceftriaxone iv b : 1 g once daily for at least 3 days + gentamicin im: 5 mg/kg once daily for 3 days in the event of sepsis then change to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid po (or another antibiotic depending on the antibiotic susceptibility test) to complete 10 to 14 days of treatment preferably use the combination ampicillin + gentamicin to cover enterococci. pyelonephritis with abscess formation or emphysematous pyelonephritis may require longer antibiotherapy. treatment of fever and pain: do not administer nsaid (fever, chapter 1). maintain proper hydration (1.5 litres daily in adults), especially in children (risk of dehydration); treat dehydration if present (see dehydration, chapter 1). management of septic shock if needed. footnotes (a) pyelonephritis is rare in men; bacterial prostatitis should be suspected in the event of febrile urinary tract infection. page 30 2/ 409(b) the solvent of ceftriaxone for im injection contains lidocaine. ceftriaxone

many infections are asymptomatic; laboratory tests available in the field are not always reliable; mixed infections are common; sexual partners need to be treated simultaneously in case of sexually transmitted infections a and the risk of recurrence or treatment failure is increased in hiv-infected patients. thus, the who has introduced the syndromic management of gi and developed standardised case management flowcharts: based on the identification of consistent groups of signs and symptoms (syndromes), patients are treated for the pathogens/infections b that may cause each syndrome. look for a gi if a patient complains of: see urethral discharge urethral discharge painful or difficult urination (dysuria) abnormal vaginal discharge abnormal vaginal discharge vulvar itching/burning pain with intercourse (dyspareunia) painful or difficult urination (dysuria) genital blisters or sores genital ulcers burning sensation in the vulva or perineum skin growths in the genital (or anal) area venereal warts lower abdominal pain (in women) lower abdominal pain upper genital tract infections basic principles of gi management the patient can be effectively treated without laboratory testing. some tests may help in diagnosing vaginal and urethral discharge, but they should never delay treatment (results should be available within one hour). the patient should be treated at his/her first encounter with the health care provider (no patient should be sent home without treatment, e.g. while waiting for laboratory results). single dose regimens are preferred when indicated. in the case of urethral discharge, abnormal vaginal discharge (except candidiasis), genital ulcers (except herpes) and sexually transmitted upper genital tract infection, the sexual partner should receive a treatment. in the case of candidiasis, genital herpes and venereal warts, the partner is treated only if symptomatic. patients with sexually transmitted infections should receive information on their disease(s) and treatment and be counselled on risk reduction and hiv testing. condoms should be provided for the duration of treatment. special situation: sexual violence page 30 5/ 409taking into consideration the physical, psychological, legal and social consequences of sexual violence, medical care is not limited to the diagnosis and treatment of genital lesions or infections. care includes listening to the victim’s story, a complete physical examination, laboratory tests if available, and completion of a medical certificate. during the consultation, prophylactic or curative treatments must be proposed to the patient. prophylactic treatment: priority is given to: a) the risk of hiv transmission. start antiretroviral therapy as early as possible if the patient is seen within 48- 72 hours after exposure (see hiv infection and aids, chapter 8); b) the risk of pregnancy resulting from rape. administer emergency contraception as soon as possible, ideally within 72 hours after the rape c : levonorgestrel po, one 1.5 mg tablet single dose (including in women receiving hiv post-exposure prophylaxis); double the dose (3 mg) only if the patient was already taking an enzyme-inducing drug (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, certain antiretrovirals) before the rape; or ulipristal po, one 30 mg tablet single dose; or a copper intrauterine device (except in case of active genital infection); prevention of sexually transmitted infections: a single dose of azithromycin po 2 g + ceftriaxone im 500 mg (or, if ceftriaxone is not available, cefixime po 400 mg). if necessary, treatment of trichomoniasis may be started later than the other treatments (tinidazole or metronidazole po, 2 g single dose); tetanus prophylaxis and/or vaccination (see tetanus, chapter 7) if there are any wounds; vaccination against hepatitis b (accelerated vaccination schedule, see viral hepatitis, chapter 8). curative treatment: of any related pathologies/infections if the assault is not recent. of wounds, mental health care is necessary irrespective of any delay between the event and the patient arriving for a consultation. care is based on immediate attention (one-on-one reception and listening) and if necessary, follow-up care with a view to detecting and treating any psychological and/or psychiatric sequelae (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.). see chapter 11. footnotes (a) gi may be sexually transmitted (e.g. gonorrhoea, chlamydia) or not (e.g. most cases of candidiasis). (b) keep in mind that in schistosoma haematobium endemic areas, genital symptoms may also be due to, or associated with, genitourinary schistosomiasis (see schistosomiasis, chapter 6). (c) nevertheless, between 72 and 120 hours (5 days) after the rape, emergency contraception is still sufficiently effective to be administered. page 30 6/ 409urethral discharge last updated: august 2022 urethral discharge is seen almost exclusively in men. the principal causative organisms are neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) and chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia). abnormal discharge should be confirmed by performing a clinical examination a . in males, the urethra should be milked gently if no discharge is visible. furthermore, specifically check for urethral discharge in patients complaining of painful or difficult urination (dysuria). case management laboratory c. trachomatis cannot easily be identified in a field laboratory. in the absence of validated rapid diagnostic tests, the treatment is empiric. in men, a methylene blue or gram stained smear from a urethral swab may be used to detect gonococci (gram negative intracellular diplococci). treatment of the patient in women: same treatment as cervicitis. in men: if microscopy of a urethral smear has been performed: in the absence of gonococci, treat for chlamydia alone; in the presence of gonococci, treat for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. when no laboratory is available, treat for chlamydia and gonorrhoea as below: page 30 7/ 409treatment for chlamydia treatment for gonorrhoea azithromycin po: 1 g single dose plus ceftriaxone im: 500 mg single dose or or, if ceftriaxone is not available, doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily for cefixime po: 400 mg single dose 7 days if urethral discharge persists or reappears after 7 days: verify that the patient has received an effective treatment (i.e. one of the combinations above). gonococcal resistance is a possibility if another treatment (e.g. co-trimoxazole or kanamycin) has been administered: re-treat for gonorrhoea as above (chlamydia is rarely resistant). if an effective antibiotic therapy has been given, consider trichomoniasis (tinidazole or metronidazole po, 2 g single dose); also consider reinfection. treatment of the partner the sexual partner receives the same treatment as the patient, whether or not symptoms are present. footnotes (a) in areas where lymphatic filariasis is endemic, be careful not to confuse purulent urethral discharge with milky or rice-water urine (chyluria) suggestive of lymphatic filariasis. page 30 8/ 409abnormal vaginal discharge last updated: august 2022 abnormal vaginal discharge is defined as discharge that is different from usual with respect to colour/odour/consistency (e.g. discoloured or purulent or malodorous). abnormal discharge is often associated with vulvar pruritus or pain with intercourse (dyspareunia), or painful or difficult urination (dysuria) or lower abdominal pain. routinely check for abnormal vaginal discharge in women presenting with these symptoms. abnormal vaginal discharge may be a sign of infection of the vagina (vaginitis) and/or the cervix (cervicitis) or upper genital tract infection. abnormal discharge must be clinically confirmed: inspection of the vulva, speculum exam checking for cervical/vaginal inflammation or discharge. abdominal and bimanual pelvic examinations should be performed routinely in all women presenting with vaginal discharge to rule out upper genital tract infection (lower abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness). the principal causative organisms are: in vaginitis: gardnerella vaginalis and other bacteria (bacterial vaginosis), trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis) and candida albicans (candidiasis). in cervicitis: neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) and chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia). in upper genital tract infections: see upper genital tract infections. case management page 30 9/ 409cervicitis may be difficult to diagnose. when in doubt, administer treatment for cervicitis to women with abnormal vaginal discharge and any of the following risk factors: urethral discharge in the partner context of sexual violence or prostitution new partner or more than one partner in the preceding 3 months laboratory xpert molecular (pcr) tests are recommended for the detection of c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoea. microscopic examination of a fresh wet smear may show mobile t. vaginalis, yeast cells and hyphae in candidiasis, and “clue cells” in bacterial vaginosis. identification of n. gonorrhoeae by gram-stained smear is not sensitive in women and is not recommended. treatment of the patient cervicitis treat for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea. page 31 0/ 409treatment for chlamydia treatment for gonorrhoea non-pregnant women azithromycin po: 1 g single dose plus ceftriaxone im: 500 mg single dose or or, if not available, doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily cefixime po: 400 mg single dose for 7 days pregnant women azithromycin po: 1 g single dose plus ceftriaxone im: 500 mg single dose or or, if not available, erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily cefixime po: 400 mg single dose or 500 mg 4 times daily for 7 days bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis tinidazole po: 2 g single dose or metronidazole po: 2 g single dose in the case of treatment failure: tinidazole po: 500 mg 2 times daily for 5 days or metronidazole po: 400 to 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days vulvovaginal candidiasis clotrimazole (500 mg vaginal tab): 1 tablet inserted deep into the vagina at bedtime, single dose if the patient has extensive vulvar involvement, miconazole 2% cream (one application to the vulva 2 times daily for 7 days) may be used in combination with the intravaginal treatment above. miconazole cream may complement, but does not replace, treatment with clotrimazole. treatment of the partner when the patient is treated for vaginitis or cervicitis, the partner receives the same treatment as the patient, whether or not symptoms are present. in the case of vulvovaginal candidiasis, the partner is treated only if symptomatic (itching and redness of the glans/prepuce): miconazole 2% cream, one application 2 times daily for 7 days. page 31 1/ 409genital ulcers genital ulcers, defined as single or multiple vesicular, ulcerative or erosive lesions of the genital tract, with or without inguinal lymphadenopathy, should lead to consideration of sexually transmitted infection. the principal causative organisms are treponema pallidum (syphilis), haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid) and herpes simplex (genital herpes). chlamydia trachomatis (lymphogranuloma venereum) and calymmatobacterium granulomatis (donovanosis) a are less frequent. case management laboratory laboratory testing available in the field is of little value: e.g., in syphilis, a negative rpr or vdrl result does not exclude primary syphilis in early stage, and a positive test may reflect previous infection in a successfully treated patient. treatment of the patient genital herpes local treatment: clean the area with soap and water. antiviral treatment: aciclovir po page 31 2/ 409in patients with a first episode, treatment may reduce the duration of symptoms when given within 5 days after the onset of symptoms: 400 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. in patients with recurrence, give the same dose for 5 days, but treatment is only effective if initiated during the prodromal phase or within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. in patients with frequent recurrences (more than 6 episodes par year), see hiv infection and aids, chapter 8. treatment of pain: paracetamol po (chapter 1). syphilis benzathine benzylpenicillin im: 2.4 mui per injection (half the dose in each buttock) [1] . early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent infection of less than 12 months duration): single dose late latent syphilis (infection of more than 12 months duration or of unknown duration): one injection weekly for 3 weeks or, for penicillin-allergic patients or if penicillin is not available: erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily or 500 mg 4 times daily for 14 days (early syphilis) or 30 days (late latent syphilis) or doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days (early syphilis) or 30 days (late latent syphilis) b or azithromycin po: 2 g single dose (only in cases of early syphilis and only if the strain is sensitive) [2] chancroid azithromycin po: 1 g single dose or ceftriaxone im: 250 mg single dose or erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily or 500 mg 4 times daily for 7 days fluctuant lymph nodes may be aspirated through healthy skin as required. do not incise and drain lymph nodes. note: treat simultaneously for syphilis and chancroid as both are frequent, and cannot be correctly distinguished on clinical grounds. lymphogranuloma venereum erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily or 500 mg 4 times daily for 14 days or doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days b fluctuant lymph nodes may be aspirated through healthy skin as required. do not incise and drain lymph nodes. donovanosis treatment is given until the complete disappearance of the lesions (usually, several weeks; otherwise risk of recurrence): azithromycin po: 1 g on d1 then 500 mg once daily or erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily or 500 mg 4 times daily or doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily b in hiv infected patients, add gentamicin im: 6 mg/kg once daily. treatment of the partner page 31 3/ 409the sexual partner receives the same treatment as the patient, whether or not symptoms are present, except in the case of genital herpes (the partner is treated only if symptomatic). footnotes (a) lymphogranuloma venereum is endemic in east and west africa, india, southeast asia, south america and the caribbean. donovanosis is endemic in south africa, papua new guinea, india, brazil and the caribbean.

and/or the fallopian tubes (salpingitis), which may be complicated by peritonitis, pelvic abscess or septicaemia. ugti may be sexually transmitted or arise after childbirth or abortion. antibiotic choices are directed by the most common pathogens in each scenario. if peritonitis or pelvic abscess is suspected, request a surgical opinion while initiating antibiotic therapy. clinical features sexually transmitted infections diagnosis may be difficult, as clinical presentation is variable. suggestive symptoms are: abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, fever, dyspareunia, menometrorrhagia, dysuria. infection is probable when one or more of the above symptoms are associated with one or more of the following signs: cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, tender abdominal mass. infections after childbirth or abortion most cases present with a typical clinical picture, developing within 2 to 10 days after delivery (caesarean section or vaginal delivery) or abortion (spontaneous or induced): fever, generally high abdominal or pelvic pain malodorous or purulent lochia enlarged, soft and/or tender uterus check for retained placenta. in the early stages, fever may be absent or moderate and abdominal pain may be mild. treatment criteria for hospitalisation include: clinical suspicion of severe or complicated infection (e.g. peritonitis, abscess, septicaemia) diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. suspicion of extra-uterine pregnancy, appendicitis) significant obstacles to ambulatory oral treatment no improvement after 48 hours, or deterioration within 48 hours, of outpatient treatment all other patients may be treated on an ambulatory basis. they should be reassessed routinely on the third day of treatment to evaluate clinical improvement (decrease in pain, absence of fever). if it is difficult to organise routine follow-up, advise patients to return to clinic if there is no improvement after 48 hours of treatment, or sooner if their condition is worsening. sexually transmitted infections antibiotic therapy combines 3 antibiotics to cover the most frequent causative organisms: gonococci, chlamydiae, and anaerobes. ambulatory treatment: cefixime po: 400 mg single dose or ceftriaxone im: 500 mg single dose page 31 6/ 409+ doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days a + metronidazole po: 500 mg 2 times daily for 14 days treatment in hospital: ceftriaxone im or iv b : 1 g once daily + doxycycline po: 100 mg 2 times daily for 14 days a + metronidazole po or iv infusion: 500 mg 2 times daily for 14 days continue triple therapy for 24 to 48 hours after signs and symptoms have improved (resolution of fever, decrease in pain), then continue doxycycline (or erythromycin) + metronidazole to complete 14 days of treatment. if an iud is in place, it should be removed (offer another method of contraception). analgesic treatment according to pain intensity. treatment of the partner: single dose treatment for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia (as for urethral discharge), whether or not symptoms are present. infections after childbirth or abortion antibiotic therapy: treatment must cover the most frequent causative organisms: anaerobes, gram negatives and streptococci. ambulatory treatment (early stages only): amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) po for 7 days use formulations in a ratio of 8:1 or 7:1 exclusively. the dose is expressed in amoxicillin: ratio 8:1: 3000 mg daily (2 tablets of 500/62.5 mg 3 times daily) ratio 7:1: 2625 mg daily (1 tablet of 875/125 mg 3 times daily) or amoxicillin po: 1 g 3 times daily + metronidazole po: 500 mg 3 times daily doses for 7 days treatment in hospital: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) iv (dose expressed in amoxicillin): 1 g every 8 hours + gentamicin im: 5 mg/kg once daily or ampicillin iv: 2 g every 8 hours + metronidazole iv infusion: 500 mg every 8 hours + gentamicin im: as above stop antibiotic therapy 48 hours after resolution of fever and clinical signs and symptoms. in penicillin-allergic patients, use clindamycin iv (900 mg every 8 hours) + gentamicin (as above). in case of placental retention: perform digital curettage or manual vacuum extraction (refer to the guide essential obstetric and newborn care, msf) 24 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy. analgesic treatment according to pain intensity. if the patient’s condition deteriorates or if fever persists after 48-72 hours of treatment, consider the possibility of complication requiring additional treatment (e.g. pelvic abscess drainage), otherwise change the antibiotic to ceftriaxone + doxycycline + metronidazole as in hospital-based treatment of sexually transmitted ugti. footnotes (a) in pregnant/breastfeeding women: erythromycin po: 1 g 2 times daily or 500 mg 4 times daily for 14 days single dose azithromycin is not effective against chlamydia in the treatment of sexually transmitted ugti. (b) the solvent of ceftriaxone for im injection contains lidocaine. ceftriaxone reconstituted using this solvent must never be administered by iv route. for iv administration, water for injection must always be used. page 31 7/ 409venereal warts venereal warts are benign tumours of the skin or mucous membranes due to certain papilloma viruses (hpv). clinical features venereal warts are soft, raised, painless growths, sometimes clustered (cauliflower- like appearance) or macules (flat warts), which are more difficult to discern. warts can be external (vulva, penis, scrotum, perineum, anus) and/or internal (vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum; oral cavity in hiv infected patients). in women, the presence of external warts is an indication for a speculum examination to exclude vaginal or cervical warts. speculum exam may reveal a friable, fungating tumour on the cervix, suggestive of cancer associated with papilloma virus a . treatment choice of treatment depends on the size and location of the warts. treatment may be less effective, and relapses more frequent, in hiv infected patients. external warts < 3 cm and vaginal warts podophyllotoxin 0.5% b solution may be self-applied by the patient, but in the event of vaginal warts, the treatment must be applied by medical staff. explain the procedure to the patient: apply the solution to the warts using an applicator or cotton bud, sparing the surrounding healthy skin, allow to air dry. on vaginal warts, the solution should be allowed to dry before the speculum is withdrawn. apply the solution 2 times daily, 3 consecutive days per week, for up to 4 weeks. podophyllum preparations are contra-indicated in pregnant c or breastfeeding women. they should not be applied on cervical, intra-urethral, rectal, oral or extensive warts. improper use may result in painful ulceration. external warts > 3 cm; cervical, intra-urethral, rectal and oral warts; warts in pregnant or breastfeeding women surgical excision or cryotherapy or electrocoagulation. footnotes (a) certain types of hpv may cause cancer. presence of genital warts in women is an indication to screen for precancerous lesions of the cervix, if feasible in the context (visual inspection with acetic acid, or cervical smear, or other available techniques), and to treat any lesions identified (cryotherapy, conisation, etc., according to diagnosis). (b) podophyllum 10%, 15% or 25% resin is another preparation which is much more caustic, and should be applied only by medical staff. protect the surrounding skin (vaseline or zinc oxide ointment) before applying the resin. wash off with soap and water after 1 to 4 hours. apply once weekly for 4 weeks. (c) treatment of warts is not an emergency and may be deferred if alternatives to podophyllum preparations are not available. genital warts are not an indication for caesarean section: it is uncommon for warts to interfere with delivery, and the risk of mother-to-child transmission is very low. page 31 8/ 409major genital infections (summary) last updated: july 2021 page 31 9/ 409pathogens/ clinical features investigations treatment infections neisseria in women: best method is pcr ceftriaxone im: 500 mg gonorrhoeae vaginal discharge, cervicitis (xpert), if available. single dose (gonorrhoea) (mucopurulent cervical discharge), in men (not sensitive or, if not available, dysuria (50% of infections are enough in women): gram cefixime po: 400 mg asymptomatic); or methylene blue stain: single dose ugti (salpingitis, endometritis). intracellular diplococci treat also for in men: purulent urethral discharge and polymorphonuclear chlamydia. and sometimes dysuria (5 to 50% of leukocytes (more than 4 in case of upper genital infections are asymptomatic). per field). tract infection, see ugti. chlamydia in women: the best method is pcr azithromycin po: 1 g trachomatis vaginal discharge, cervicitis, and (xpert), if available. single dose (chlamydia) rarely dysuria (> 50% of or doxycycline po (a) : infections are asymptomatic); 200 mg daily for 7 days ugti (salpingitis, endometritis). treat also for in men: mild urethral discharge and/or gonococcal infection dysuria but up to 90% of infections (except when a gram are asymptomatic. stain in males or pcr shows no n. gonorrhoeae). in case of upper genital tract infection, see ugti. trichomonas in women: yellow-green vaginal wet mount of fresh tinidazole or vaginalis discharge, sometimes foul smelling, vaginal fluid shows motile metronidazole po: 2 g (trichomoniasis) vulvar irritation (10 to 50% of trichomonas (low single dose infections are asymptomatic). sensitivity). in men: most infections are ph of urethral/vaginal asymptomatic. can produce fluid > 4.5. balanitis, urethritis with mild discharge and sometimes dysuria. bacterial diagnosis is made in the presence of 3 of the following 4 signs: tinidazole or vaginosis homogenous grey-white adherent vaginal discharge metronidazole po: 2 g (gardnerella ph of vaginal fluid > 4.5 single dose vaginalis and vaginal fluid has an amine (fishy) odour, especially when mixed with other 10% koh associated presence of clue cells in wet mount or gram stain of vaginal fluid bacteria) candida mainly seen in women: pruritus and saline of koh wet mount in women: albicans vulvovaginitis, frequently creamy- of fresh vaginal fluid clotrimazole 500 (candidiasis) white vaginal discharge, sometimes shows budding yeast mg: one vaginal dysuria. cells and pseudohyphae. tablet single dose page 32 0/ 409in men: balanitis/balanoposthitis ph of vaginal fluid: in men: (inflammation of the glans/prepuce, normal miconazole 2% erythema, pruritus, white pustules) cream: 1 application and rarely urethritis 2 times daily for 7 days herpes many asymptomatic carriers. multiple diagnosis by culture, analgesics, local simplex vesicles on genitals leading to painful serology and pcr done disinfection. virus type 2 ulcerations. in women, affects vulva, exclusively at a reference if available, aciclovir (genital herpes) vagina and cervix; in males, penis and laboratory. po: sometimes urethra. in primary episodes, primary episode: fever (30%) and lymphadenopathy 1200 mg daily for 7 (50%). recurrences in 1/3 of infections days, given within 5 with shorter and milder symptoms. days after onset of lesions. recurrent infections: same dose for 5 days, given within 24 hours after onset of lesions. treponema single firm painless genital ulcer, often rpr/vdrl lack sensitivity benzathine pallidum unnoticed. and specificity, but may be benzylpenicillin im: (syphilis) useful for following 2.4 miu per injection, treatment effectiveness single dose (syphylis < (decrease in titer) or 12 months) or once confirming re-infection (rise weekly for 3 weeks in titer).

pyomyositis leg ulcers necrotising infections of the skin and soft tissues venomous bites and stings dental infections page 32 5/ 409dressings the objective of dressing wounds is to promote healing. the procedure includes cleaning, disinfection and protection of the wound while respecting the rules of hygiene. not all wounds need to be covered by a dressing (e.g. a clean wound that has been sutured for several days; a small dry wound not requiring sutures). equipment sterile instruments one kocher or pean forceps one dissecting forceps one pair of surgical scissors or one scalpel to excise necrotic tissue and to cut gauze or sutures instruments for one dressing for one patient must be wrapped together in paper or fabric (or can be placed in a metallic box) and sterilised together to limit handling and breaks in asepsis. 5 to 10 compresses may be included in this set. if there are no sterile instruments, a dressing can be done using sterile gloves. renewable supplies sterile compresses non-sterile disposable gloves adhesive tape and/or crepe or gauze bandage sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water depending on the wound: antiseptic (7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution, 10% povidone iodine dermal solution), paraffin compresses, analgesics organisation of care proper organization of care helps maintain the rules of asepsis and decreases the risk of contamination of the wound or transmission of organisms from one patient to another: assign one room for dressings. it must be cleaned and the waste removed every day. the dressing table must be disinfected after each patient. dressings may be applied at the bedside if the patient’s condition requires. use a clean, disinfected dressing trolley with: on the upper tray, sterile and/or clean material (dressing set, extra compresses, etc.) and on the lower tray, septic material (container for contaminated instruments, sharps disposal container and a container or garbage bag for waste). prepare all the necessary material in a well lit area. if necessary, arrange for an assistant to be present. wear protective glasses if there is a risk of projection from an oozing wound. always proceed from clean to dirty: start with patients with uninfected wounds. if there are multiple dressings for one patient, start with the cleanest wound. technique if the procedure may be painful, give an analgesic and wait the necessary time for the drug to take effect before starting the procedure. settle the patient comfortably in an area where his privacy is respected throughout the procedure. explain the procedure to the patient and obtain his co-operation. instruments (or sterile gloves) must be changed between patients. page 32 6/ 409to prevent drug interactions, use the same antiseptic for all care of one patient. removal of an old dressing wash hands (ordinary soap) or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub. put on non-sterile gloves and remove the adhesive tape, bandage and superficial compresses. proceed gently with the last compresses. if they stick to the wound, loosen them with 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water before removal. observe the soiled compresses. if there is significant discharge, a greenish colour or a foul odour, a wound infection is likely. discard the dressing and the non-sterile gloves in the waste container. observe the wound in the case of an open wound, loss of cutaneous tissue or ulcer, the colour is an indicator of the stage in the healing process: black area = necrosis, wet or dry infected eschar yellow or greenish area = infected tissue and presence of pus red area = granulation, usually a sign of healing (unless there is hypertrophy), however, red edges indicate inflammation or infection pink area = process of epithelisation, the final stage of healing that begins at the edges of the wound in the case of a sutured wound, the existence of local signs of suppuration and pain requires the removal of one or more sutures to avoid the infection spreading. local signs include: red, indurated and painful edges drainage of pus between the sutures, either spontaneously or when pressure is applied on either side of the wound lymphangitis sub-cutaneous crepitations around the wound in any case, if local signs of infection are observed, look for general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition). technique for cleaning and dressing of the wound wash hands again or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub. open the dressing set or box after checking the date of sterilisation and that the wrapping is intact. pick up one of the sterile forceps being careful not to touch anything else. pick up the second forceps with the help of the first one. make a swab by folding a compress in 4 using the forceps. clean sutured wound or clean open wound with red granulation: clean with 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water to remove any organic residue; work from the cleanest to the dirtiest area (use a clean swab for each stroke); dab dry with a sterile compress; re-cover a sutured wound with sterile compresses or an open wound with paraffin compresses; the dressing should extend a few cm beyond the edges of the wound; keep the dressing in place with adhesive tape or a bandage. necrotic or infected open wounds: clean with povidone iodine (7.5% scrub solution, 1 part of solution + 4 parts of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water). rinse thoroughly then dab dry with a sterile compress; or if not available, sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water and apply an antiseptic (10% povidone iodine dermal solution). apply sterile vaseline and remove all necrotic tissue at each dressing change until the wound is clean. page 32 7/ 409discard any sharp materials used in an appropriate sharps container and the rest of the waste in a waste container. as quickly as possible, soak the instruments in disinfectant. wash hands again or disinfect them with an alcohol-based hand rub. the principles remain the same if the dressing is done using instruments or sterile gloves. subsequent dressings clean, sutured wound: remove the initial dressing after 5 days if the wound remains painless and odourless, and if the dressing remains clean. the decision to re-cover or to leave the wound uncovered (if it is dry) often depends on the context and local practices. infected, sutured wound: remove one or more sutures and evacuate the pus. change the dressing at least once daily. open, dirty wound: daily cleaning and dressing change. open granulating wound: change the dressing every 2 to 3 days, except if the granulation is hypertrophic (in this case, apply local corticosteroids). page 32 8/ 409treatment of a simple wound a simple wound is a break in the continuity of the skin limited in depth at the sub-cutaneous fatty tissue, that does not affect the underlying structures (muscle, bone, joints, major arteries, nerves, tendons) and without significant loss of tissue. the goal of treatment is to assure rapid healing of the wound without complications or sequelae. several basic rules apply: rapidly treat wounds, while maintaining the rules of asepsis and the order of the initial procedures: cleaning- exploration-excision; identify wounds that need to be sutured and those for which suturing would be harmful or dangerous; immediately suture recent, clean, simple wounds (less than 6 hours old) and delay suturing contaminated wounds and/or those more than 6 hours old; prevent local (abscess) or general (gas gangrene; tetanus) infections. equipment instruments (figures 1a to 1d) one dissecting forceps, one needle-holder, one pair of surgical scissors and one pean or kocher forceps are usually enough. one or two other artery forceps, a pair of farabeuf retractors and a scalpel may be useful for a contused or deep wound. instruments to suture one wound for one patient must be packaged and sterilised together (suture box or set) to limit handling and breaks in asepsis. renewable supplies for local anaesthesia: sterile syringe and needle; 1% lidocaine (without epinephrine) sterile gloves, fenestrated sterile towel sterile absorbable and non-absorbable sutures antiseptic and supplies for dressings for drainage: corrugated rubber drain or equivalent, nylon suture technique settle the patient comfortably in an area with good lighting and ensure all the necessary material is prepared. explain the procedure to the patient and ensure his co-operation. if the patient is a young child, arrange to have an assistant hold the child if necessary. initial cleaning wear suitable clothing: sterile gloves for all wounds and a gown and protective glasses if there is a risk of projection from a bleeding wound. start by washing the wound, prolong the cleaning if the wound is particularly soiled. use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse. if necessary use a sterile brush. cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion. page 32 9/ 409if the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care. exploration wash hands and put on sterile gloves. disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine. cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel. local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect. proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant. consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration): a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture, a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound, a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons, a wound close to a major artery may be an arterial wound even if it is no longer bleeding. look for and remove any foreign bodies. in the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room. wound excision the goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection. the wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. the excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive. limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds. sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue. immediate suturing of a simple wound immediate suturing may have serious consequences for the patient if precautions to prevent infection and promote healing are not taken. the decision to suture immediately can only be taken after the cleaning, exploration and satisfactory excision, and if the following conditions are met: simple wound, no more than 6 hours old with no devitalised or contused tissue (the wound may be as long as 24 hours old if on the face, scalp, upper limbs or hands). bites (for local treatment see rabies, chapter 8) and bullet, shell or mine shrapnel wounds should not be immediately sutured. delayed suturing of a simple wound wounds that do not fill the above conditions should not be immediately sutured. after cleaning, exploration and excision a simple dressing is applied to the open wound. further cleaning and removal of any remaining necrotic tissue is completed with daily dressing changes. if after 72 hours there are no signs of local infection, the wound may be sutured. healing by second intention of infected wounds page 33 0/ 409if the wound does not meet the conditions of cleanliness described above, the wound cannot be sutured. it will heal either spontaneously (healing by secondary intention), or will require a skin graft (once the wound is clean) if there is significant loss of tissue. figures 1 : basic instruments figure 1a figure 1b kocher forceps, kelly forceps, straight, toothed

of infection and permanent sequelae evaluation for the presence of inhalation injury dyspnoea with chest wall indrawing, bronchospasm, soot in the nares or mouth, productive cough, carbonaceous sputum, hoarseness, etc. treatment of severe burns i. initial management on admission ensure airway is patent; high-flow oxygen, even when spo is normal. 2 establish iv access, through unburned skin if possible (intraosseous access if iv access is not possible). ringer lactate (rl): 20 ml/kg during the first hour, even if the patient is stable. morphine sc: 0.2 mg/kg (step 1 and step 2 analgesics are not effective). in the event of chemical burns: flush with copious amounts of water for 15 to 30 minutes, avoiding contamination of healthy skin; do not attempt to neutralize the chemical agent. once the patient is stabilized remove clothes if they are not adherent to the burn. take history of the burn injury: mechanism, causative agent, time, etc. assess the burn injury: extent, depth, carbonization; ocular burns, burns at risk of secondary functional deficits; circumferential burns of the extremities, chest or neck. wear face mask and sterile gloves during the examination. assess for associated injuries (fractures, etc.). protect the patient and keep him warm: clean/sterile sheet, survival blanket. insert a urinary catheter if burns involve > 15% of bsa, and in the case of electrical burns or burns of the perineum/genitalia. page 33 9/ 409insert a nasogastric tube if burns involve > 20% of bsa (in the operating room while carrying out dressing procedure). calculate and initiate fluid and electrolyte requirements for the first 24 hours. intensive monitoring: level of consciousness, heart rate, blood pressure, spo , respiratory rate (rr) hourly; 2 temperature and urine output every 4 hours. additional testing: haemoglobin, blood group, urine dipstick test. prepare the patient for the first dressing procedure in the operating room. notes: burns do not bleed in the initial stage: check for haemorrhage if haemoglobin level is normal or low. burns alone do not alter the level of consciousness. in the case if altered consciousness, consider head injury, intoxication, postictal state in epileptic patients. clinical manifestations of electrical burns vary significantly according to the type of current. look for complications (arrhythmia, rhabdomyolysis, neurological disorders). ii. general measures during the first 48 hours resuscitative measures intravenous replacement fluid to correct hypovolaemia: fluid and electrolyte requirements

predisposition to infection). no specific treatment for direct bronchopulmonary lesions. analgesia see pain management nutrition start feeding early, beginning at h8: daily needs in adults calories: 25 kcal/kg + 40 kcal/% bsa proteins: 1.5 to 2 g/kg high energy foods (nrg5, plumpy'nut, f100 milk) are necessary if the bsa is > 20% (normal food is inadequate). nutritional requirements are administered according to the following distribution: carbohydrates 50%, lipids 30%, proteins 20%. provide 5-10 times the recommended daily intake of vitamins and trace elements. enteral feeds are preferred: oral route or nasogastric tube (necessary if bsa > 20%). start with small quantities on d1, then increase progressively to reach recommended energy requirements within 3 days. assess nutritional status regularly (weigh 2 times weekly). reduce energy loss: occlusive dressings, warm environment (28-33 °c), early grafting; management of pain, insomnia and depression. patients at risk of rhabdomyolysis in the event of deep and extensive burns, electrical burns, crush injuries to the extremities: monitor for myoglobinuria: dark urine and urine dipstick tests. if present: induce alkaline diuresis for 48 hours (20 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate per litre of rl) to obtain an output of 1 to 2 ml/kg/hour. do not administer dopamine or furosemide. infection control page 34 1/ 409precautions against infection are of paramount importance until healing is complete. infection is one of the most frequent and serious complications of burns: hygiene precautions (e.g. sterile gloves when handling patients). rigorous wound management (dressing changes, early excision). separate “new” patients (< 7 days from burn) from convalescent patients (≥ 7 days from burn). do not administer antibiotherapy in the absence of systemic infection. infection is defined by the presence of at least 2 of 4 following signs: temperature > 38.5 °c or < 36 °c, tachycardia, tachypnoea, elevation of white blood cell count by more than 100% (or substantial decrease in the number of white blood cells). in the event of systemic infection, start empiric antibiotherapy: cefazolin iv children > 1 month: 25 mg/kg every 8 hours adults : 2 g every 8 hours + ciprofloxacin po children > 1 month: 15 mg/kg 2 times daily adults: 500 mg 3 times daily local infection, in the absence of signs of systemic infection, requires topical treatment with silver sulfadiazine. not to be applied to children under 2 months. other treatments omeprazole iv from d1 children: 1 mg/kg once daily adults: 40 mg once daily tetanus vaccination (see tetanus, chapter 7). thromboprophylaxis: low molecular weight heparin sc beginning 48 to 72 hours post-injury. physiotherapy from d1 (prevention of contractures), analgesia is necessary. intentional burns (suicide attempt, aggression): appropriate psychological follow-up. iii. local treatment regular dressing changes a prevent infection, decrease heat and fluid losses, reduce energy loss, and promote patient comfort. dressings should be occlusive, assist in relieving pain, permit mobilisation, and prevent contractures. basic principles rigorous adherence to the principles of asepsis. dressing changes require morphine administration in the non-anaesthetised patient. the first dressing procedure is performed in the operating room under general anaesthesia, the following in an operating room under general anaesthesia or at the bedside with morphine. technique at the time of the first dressing procedure, shave any hairy areas (armpit, groin, pubis) if burns involve the adjacent tissues; scalp (anteriorly in the case of facial burns, entirely in the case of cranial burns). cut nails. clean the burn with povidone iodine scrub solution (1 volume of 7.5% povidone iodine + 4 volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water). scrub gently with compresses, taking care to avoid bleeding. remove blisters with forceps and scissors. rinse with 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile water. dry the skin by blotting with sterile compresses. apply silver sulfadiazine directly by hand (wear sterile gloves) in a uniform layer of 3-5 mm to all burned areas (except eyelids and lips) to children 2 months and over and adults. page 34 2/ 409apply a greasy dressing (jelonet® or petrolatum gauze) using a back and forth motion (do not use a circular movement). cover with a sterile compresses, unfolded into a single layer. never encircle a limb with a single compress. wrap with a crepe bandage, loosely applied. elevate extremities to prevent oedema; immobilise in extension. frequency routinely: every 48 hours. daily in the event of superinfection or in certain areas (e.g. perineum). monitoring distal ischaemia of the burned limb is the main complication during the first 48 hours. assess for signs of ischaemia: cyanosis or pallor of the extremity, dysaesthesia, hyperalgia, impaired capillary refill. monitor daily: pain, bleeding, progression of healing and infection. iv. surgical care emergency surgical interventions escharotomy: in the case of circumferential burns of arms, legs or fingers, in order to avoid ischaemia, and circumferential burns of chest or neck that compromise respiratory movements. tracheotomy: in the event of airway obstruction due to oedema (e.g. deep cervicofacial burns). tracheotomy can be performed through a burned area. tarsorrhaphy: in the event of ocular or deep eyelid burns. surgery for associated injuries (fractures, visceral lesions, etc.). burn surgery excision-grafting of deep burns, in the operating room, under general anaesthesia, between d5 and d6: excision of necrotic tissue (eschar) with simultaneous grafting with autografts of thin skin. this intervention entails significant bleeding risk, do not involve more than 15% of bsa in the same surgery. if early excision-grafting is not feasible, default to the process of sloughing-granulation-reepithelisation. sloughing occurs spontaneously due to the action of sulfadiazine/ petrolatum gauze dressings and, if necessary, by mechanical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. this is followed by granulation, which may require surgical reduction in the case of hypertrophy. the risk of infection is high and the process is prolonged (> 1 month). v. pain management all burns require analgesic treatment. pain intensity is not always predictable and regular assessment is paramount: use a simple verbal scale (svs) in children > 5 years and adults and nfcs or flacc scales in children < 5 years (see pain, chapter 1). morphine is the treatment of choice for moderate to severe pain. development of tolerance is common in burn patients and requires dose augmentation. adjuvant treatment may complement analgesic medication (e.g. massage therapy, psychotherapy). continuous pain (experienced at rest) moderate pain: paracetamol po + tramadol po (see pain, chapter 1) moderate to severe pain: paracetamol po + sustained release morphine po (see pain, chapter 1) page 34 3/ 409in patients with severe burns, oral drugs are poorly absorbed in the digestive tract during the first 48 hours, morphine is administered by sc route. acute pain experienced during care analgesics are given in addition to those given for continuous pain. significant medical interventions and extensive burns: general anaesthesia in an operating room. limited non-surgical interventions (dressings, painful physiotherapy): mild to moderate pain, 60 to 90 minutes before giving care: tramadol po (see pain, chapter 1) rarely allows treatment to be completed comfortably. in the event of treatment failure, use morphine. moderate or severe pain, 60 to 90 minutes before giving care: immediate release morphine po: initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg; the effective dose is usually around 1 mg/kg, but there is no maximum dose. or morphine sc: initial dose of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg; the effective dose is usually around 0.5 mg/kg, but there is no maximum dose. note: these doses of morphine are for adults, dosing is the same in children > 1 year, should be halved in children less than 1 year, and quartered in infants less than 3 months. pain management using morphine during dressing changes at the bedside requires: a trained nursing team. availability of immediate release oral morphine and naloxone. close monitoring: level of consciousness, rr, heart rate, spo , every 15 min for the first hour following dressing 2 change, then routine monitoring. assessment of pain intensity and sedation during the intervention and for 1 hour thereafter. necessary equipment for ventilation by mask and manual suction. gentle handling of the patient at all times. adjustment of morphine doses for subsequent dressings: if pain intensity (svs) is 0 or 1: continue with the same dose. if svs score ≥ 2: increase the dose by 25 to 50%. if pain control remains inadequate, the dressing change should be carried out in the operating room under anaesthesia. take advantage of the residual analgesia following dressing changes to carry out physiotherapy. as a last resort (morphine unavailable and no facilities to give general anaesthesia), in a safe setting (trained staff, resuscitation equipment, recovery room), adding ketamine im at analgesic doses (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) reinforces the analgesic effect of the paracetamol + tramadol combination given before a dressing change. chronic pain (during the rehabilitation period) the treatment is guided by self-evaluation of pain intensity, and utilises paracetamol and/or tramadol. patients may develop neuropathic pain (see pain, chapter 1). all other associated pain (physiotherapy, mobilization) should be treated as acute pain. minor burns treat as outpatients. wound care: dressings with silver sulfadiazine (to children 2 months and over and adults) or petrolatum gauze (except for first degree superficial burns). pain: paracetamol ± tramadol usually effective. page 34 4/ 409footnotes (a) open technique « naked burn patient under a mosquito net » and water immersion therapy are obsolete and should no longer be used. page 34 5/ 409cutaneous abscess a cutaneous abscess is a collection of pus within the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. it is most commonly due to staphylococcus aureus. clinical features painful, red, shiny nodule with or without fluctuance; suppuration or surrounding cellulitis (see erysipelas and cellulitis, chapter 4). regional adenopathy and fever may be present. complications: osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, septic shock (see shock, chapter 1). paraclinical investigations radiography in case of suspected osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. treatment treatment is surgical incision and drainage, under aseptic conditions (i.e. sterile consumables and instruments, antiseptic skin preparation). refer to a surgeon any cutaneous abscess: located in anterior and lateral neck, central triangle of the face, hand, perirectal region, breast, or adjacent to major blood vessels (e.g. femoral artery), or involving joint and bone. antibiotic therapy only if signs of systemic infection, extensive surrounding cellulitis or for individuals with risk factors e.g. immunosuppression or diabetes (for antibiotic therapy, see erysipelas and cellulitis, chapter 4). equipment sterile scalpel sterile curved, non-toothed artery forceps (kelly type) sterile disposable gloves and compresses antiseptic solution and 0.9% sodium chloride 5 or 10 ml syringe anaesthesia for small (approximately < 5 cm), well delineated abscess in adults: use local anaesthesia with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine (10 mg/ml): 15 to 20 ml. for larger (approximately > 5 cm), deep or poorly delineated abscess in adults or for abscess in children: consider procedural sedation or general anaesthesia (ketamine im: 10 mg/kg). for analgesia, see pain, chapter 1. technique incision (figure 8a) page 34 6/ 409hold the scalpel between the thumb and middle finger of the dominant hand, the index finger presses on the handle. hold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. the scalpel blade should be perpendicular to the skin. the incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. the incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted. figure 8a incision with a scalpel digital exploration (figure 8b) explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus (and foreign body, if present) and explore to the edges of the cavity. the exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. in this last case, seek surgical advice. figure 8b exploration of the cavity, breaking down any loculi washing abundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with 0.9% sodium chloride. drainage (figure 8c) only necessary for deep abscesses. insert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. if possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. the drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely. page 34 7/ 409figure 8c drain fixed to the skin dressing cover with sterile compresses. page 34 8/ 409pyomyositis pyomyositis is an infection of the muscle, almost always due to staphylococcus aureus. it most commonly affects the muscles of the limbs and torso. infections may occur simultaneously in multiple sites. risk factors include immunosuppression, concurrent s. aureus infection, malnutrition, trauma and injection drug use. risk of mortality is significant if treatment is delayed. clinical features signs and symptoms: local: exquisite muscle tenderness, oedema giving muscles "woody" texture on palpation. systemic: regional adenopathy and fever. pyomyositis of the psoas muscle: patient keeps hip flexed and experiences pain on hip extension. if the abscess is on the right side, the clinical signs are the same as for appendicitis with pain in the right iliac fossa. complications: septic emboli, endocarditis and septic arthritis, septic shock (see shock, chapter 1). paraclinical investigations pocus a : assists in characterisation of abscess; can rule out deep venous thrombosis. radiography: may demonstrate a foreign body, signs of osteomyelitis or osteosarcoma. treatment immobilise the limb. systematic antibiotic therapy (see erysipelas and cellulitis, chapter 4). adapt analgesics to the pain level (see pain, chapter 1). apply compresses soaked in 70% alcohol 2 times daily (max. 3 times daily to prevent burns to the skin) until incision and drainage. treatment is surgical incision and drainage, under aseptic conditions (sterile consumables and instruments, antiseptic skin preparation) following the rules for incision and drainage of abscesses (see cutaneous abscess, chapter 10). muscle abscesses are often deeper than other abscesses. as a result, aspiration with a large bore needle may be necessary to locate the abscess. needle aspiration is insufficient treatment even if pus is evacuated and should be followed by surgical incision and drainage. in case of pyomyositis of the psoas muscle, start antibiotics and refer to a surgeon. equipment and anaesthesia as for cutaneous abscess, chapter 10. technique generous incision along the axis of the limb, over the site of the abscess and avoiding underlying neurovascular stuctures; incise the skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscular fascia with a scalpel (figure 9a). dissect the muscle fibres with non-toothed forceps (kelly type) or round tipped scissors. insert the instrument or a finger into the muscle until the purulent cavity is reached. if an instrument is used, during insertion, keep the instrument closed and perpendicular to the muscle fibres. withdraw gently with the scissors or forceps slightly open, keeping instrument perpendicular to the fibres (figure 9b). if abscess is found to be very deep, it may be necessary to refer to a surgeon. page 34 9/ 409use a forefinger to explore the cavity, break down any loculi and evacuate the pus (figure 9c). wash abundantly with 0.9% sodium chloride. insert a large drain. fix the drain to the edge of the wound using a single suture. remove the drain on about the 5th day (figure 9d). figures 9: surgical incision-drainage of a pyomyositis figure 9a figure 9b long incision dissection of the muscle using kelly forceps, insert closed then withdraw with the instrument slightly open figure 9c figure 9d exploration and evacuation of pus with the finger drain fixed to the skin footnotes (a) pocus should only be performed and interpreted by trained clinicians. page 35 0/ 409leg ulcers leg ulcers are chronic losses of cutaneous tissue. they are common in tropical regions, resulting from varied aetiologies: vascular: venous and/or arterial insufficiency, bacterial: leprosy, buruli ulcer (mycobacterium ulcerans), phagedenic ulcer, yaws, syphilis, parasitic: dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), leishmaniasis, metabolic: diabetes, traumatic: trauma is often a precipitating factor combined with another underlying cause. the history of the disease and a complete clinical examination (paying particular attention to the neurological examination to determine if there is a peripheral neuropathy caused by leprosy or diabetes) usually leads to an aetiological diagnosis. all ulcers may become complicated with either local or regional secondary infections (abscess, lymphadenopathy, adenitis, osteomyelitis, erysipela, pyodermitis), generalised infection (septicaemia), tetanus and after many years of evolution, skin cancer. daily local treatment bathe the leg for 10 to 15 minutes in nadcc and rinse in boiled water. remove any necrotic (black) and fibrinous (yellowish) tissue using compresses or excise the tissue with a scalpel. apply: to a clean ulcer, with little discharge: 10% povidone iodine and vaseline; to a dirty ulcer, with little discharge: silver sulfadiazine to a limited area (monitor for systemic adverse effects); to an oozing ulcer: 10% povidone iodine alone; to an extensive, oozing ulcer or multiple ulcers: diluted povidone iodine (1/4 of 10% povidone iodine + 3/4 of 0.9% sodium chloride or clean water) for one minute then rinse with 0.9% sodium chloride or clean water to reduce the risk of transcutaneous iodine absorption. cover with a dry sterile dressing. systemic treatment treatment with analgesics in the event of pain: adapt the level and dosage to the individual (see pain, chapter 1). give systemic antibiotics in case of: secondary infection (see bacterial skin infections, chapter 4). phagedenic ulcer (in the early stages, antibiotics may be useful. they are often ineffective in the chronic stages): doxycycline po (except in children under 8 years and pregnant or lactating women) children 8 years and over: 4 mg/kg once daily adults: 200 mg once daily or metronidazole po children: 10 mg/kg 3 times daily adults: 500 mg 3 times daily if after 7 days, antibiotherapy is effective, continue with doxycycline or metronidazole as above. treatment duration varies according to the clinical evolution. treat the cause. complementary therapy: elevate the legs in cases of venous and/or lymphatic insufficiency. page 35 1/ 409tetanus prophylaxis if appropriate (see tetanus, chapter 7). skin graft if the ulcer is extensive, clean, red and flat. skin grafts are often necessary after surgical excision to heal phagedenic and buruli ulcers. page 35 2/ 409necrotising infections of the skin and soft tissues invasive infections of the soft tissues: skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial or deep fascia, muscles. they include necrotising cellulitis, necrotising fasciitis, myonecrosis, gas gangrene, etc. clinical presentation depends on the causative organism and the stage of progression. group a streptococcus is frequently isolated, as are staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae and anaerobic bacteria including clostridium sp. delay in treatment of a minor wound or certain types of wounds (gunshot wounds or stabbings, open fractures or non- sterile intramuscular injections/circumcisions) or certain infections (varicella or omphalitis), favours the development of a necrotising infection. patient risk factors include immunosuppression, diabetes, malnutrition and advanced age. a necrotising infection is a surgical emergency and has a high mortality rate. clinical features initial signs and symptoms include erythema, oedema and pain disproportionate to appearance of infection. location depends on the portal of entry. it may be difficult to differentiate necrotising infections from nonnecrotising infections (see erysipelas and cellulitis, chapter 4). systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia etc.) may be present. lesions progress rapidly despite antibiotic therapy, with the development of the typical signs of a necrotizing infection: haemorrhagic blisters and necrosis (cold bluish or blackish hypoaesthetic macules). signs of late infection: crepitus on palpation and fetid odour (gas gangrene) with signs of severe systemic infection (see shock, chapter 1). laboratory if available, the following tests can help identify an early necrotising infection: white blood cell count > 15 000/mm³ or < 4000/mm³; serum creatinine > 141 micromol/litre; serum glucose > 10 mmol/litre (180 mg/dl) or < 3.3 mmol/litre (60 mg/dl). however, normal results do not exclude a necrotising infection. obtain specimens for bacterial culture in the operating room and blood cultures if possible. paraclinical investigations radiography: may demonstrate gas in muscles or along the fascia planes. can rule out foreign body, osteomyelitis or osteosarcoma. treatment prompt surgical management accompanied by iv antibiotic therapy is essential to reduce the high mortality. refer immediately to a surgeon. start resuscitation if necessary (see shock, chapter 1). emergency surgical treatment: debridement, drainage, wide excision of necrotic tissue and rapid amputation if necessary. surgical re-evaluation within 24 to 36 hours to check for eventual progression of the necrosis and need for further debridement. page 35 3/ 409iv antibiotic therapy for at least 14 days or more depending on clinical response: cloxacillin + ceftriaxone + clindamycin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + clindamycin. for doses, see below. cloxacillin iv infusion (60 minutes) a children < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours children ≥ 40 kg and adults: 3 g every 6 hours ceftriaxone slow iv (3 minutes) or iv infusion (30 minutes) b children 1 month and over: 100 mg/kg once daily adults: 2 g once daily clindamycin iv infusion (30 minutes) c neonates 0 to 7 days (< 2 kg): 5 mg/kg every 12 hours neonates 0 to 7 days (≥ 2 kg): 5 mg/kg every 8 hours neonates 8 days to < 1 month (< 2 kg): 5 mg/kg every 8 hours neonates 8 days to < 1 month (≥ 2 kg): 10 mg/kg every 8 hours children 1 month and over: 10 to 13 mg/kg every 8 hours (max. 2700 mg daily) adults: 900 mg every 8 hours amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) slow iv injection (3 minutes) or iv infusion (30 minutes) d children less than 3 months: 50 mg/kg every 12 hours children ≥ 3 months and < 40 kg: 50 mg/kg every 8 hours (max. 6 g daily) children ≥ 40 kg and adults: 2 g every 8 hours other treatments: deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis;

rarely, shock. aetiological treatment: the use of scorpion antivenom sera is controversial (most of them are not very effective; they may be poorly tolerated due to insufficient purification). in practice, in countries where scorpion envenomations are severe (north africa, the middle east, central america and amazonia), check local availability of antivenom sera and follow national recommendations. the criteria for administration are the severity of the envenomation, the age of the patient (more severe in children) and the time elapsed since the sting. this should not exceed 2 to 3 hours. if the time elapsed is more than 2 or 3 hours, the benefit of antivenom serum is poor in comparison with the risk of anaphylaxis (in contrast to envenomation by snakes). symptomatic treatment: in the event of vomiting, diarrhoea or excessive sweating: prevention of dehydration (oral rehydration salts), especially in children. in the event of muscle pain: 10% calcium gluconate slow iv (children: 5 ml per injection, adults: 10 ml per injection, administered over 10 to 20 minutes). in the event of seizures: diazepam may be used with caution; the risk of respiratory depression is increased in envenomated patients (see seizures, chapter 1). spider bites and envenomation treatment is usually limited to wound cleansing, strict rest, analgesics po and tetanus prophylaxis (see tetanus, chapter 7). severe envenomations are rare. there are two main clinical syndromes: neurotoxic syndrome (black widow spider): severe muscle pain, tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, headache, excessive sweating. the signs develop for 24 hours and then resolve spontaneously over a few days. necrotic syndrome (recluse spider): local tissue lesions, possible necrosis and ulceration; mild general signs (fever, chills, malaise and vomiting) which usually resolve over a few days. if present, haemolysis may sometimes be life threatening. as well as the general measures listed above, treatment includes administration of 10% calcium gluconate by slow iv in the event of muscle spasms (children: 5 ml per injection, adults: 10 ml per injection, administered over 10 to 20 minutes). incision and debridement of necrotic tissue are not recommended (not useful; may impair healing). hymenoptera stings (honeybees, wasps and hornets) page 35 7/ 409local care: remove the embedded sting (bee); clean with soap and water; calamine lotion if pruriginous (children and adults: one application 3 to 4 times daily in a thin layer). analgesics if necessary (paracetamol po). in the event of an anaphylactic reaction: epinephrine (adrenaline) im use undiluted epinephrine solution (1:1000 = 1 mg/ml) and a 1 ml syringe graduated in 0.01 ml in children: children under 6 years: 0.15 ml children from 6 to 12 years: 0.3 ml children over 12 years and adults: 0.5 ml for children, if 1 ml syringe is not available, use a diluted solution, i.e. add 1 mg epinephine to 9 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain a 0.1 mg/ml solution (1:10 000): children under 6 years: 1.5 ml children from 6 to 12 years: 3 ml repeat after 5 minutes if no clinical improvement. in patients with circulatory collapse or those who deteriorate despite receiving im epinephrine, use iv epinephrine (for doses, see anaphylactic shock, chapter 1). footnotes (a) there can be a considerable delay between the decrease in coagulation factors (less than 30 minutes after the bite) and the first signs of bleeding (other than bleeding at the site of the bite and/or the development of sero-sanguinous blisters), which may appear only 3 days after the bite. conversely, bleeding may resolve prior to normalization of coagulation parameters. page 35 8/ 409dental infections infection arising as a secondary complication of an inflammation of the dental pulp. the severity and the treatment of dental infections depend on their evolution: localised to the infected tooth, extended to adjacent anatomical structures or diffuse infections. clinical features and treatment infection localised to a tooth and its surroundings (acute dental abscess) intense and continuous pain. on examination: swelling limited to the gum surrounding the infected tooth. purulent exudate may be present draining either through the root canal, or through the periodontal ligament (loosening the tooth) or through a gingival fistula. there are no signs of the infection extending to adjacent anatomical structures nor general signs of infection. treatment: treatment is only surgical (the source of infection is inaccessible to antibiotics): root canal therapy (disinfection of the root canal) if possible or extraction of the tooth. pain: paracetamol or ibuprofen po (see pain, chapter 1). infections extending to adjacent anatomical structures (acute dento-alveolar abscess) local spreading of an acute dental abscess into the surrounding bone and tissue. painful gingival and buccal swelling with warm and tender skin, developing into a ripe abscess: intense pain, with trismus, particularly if the infection is in a posterior tooth, presence of general signs (fever, fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy). in patients with acute gangrenous cellulitis (crepitations on palpation), treat as an infection extending into the cervico-facial tissues (see below). treatment: first surgical: incision and drainage of the pus or extraction of the tooth. then antibiotic treatment for 5 days following the procedure: amoxicillin po children: 25 mg/kg 2 times daily adults: 1 g 2 times daily notes: if the dental procedure has to be delayed (local anaesthesia not possible due to inflammation, significant trismus), start an antibiotherapy, but the dental procedure must be completed in the following days. if there is no improvement within 48 to 72 hours after the dental procedure, do not change antibiotic, but start a new procedure on the tooth. pain: paracetamol or ibuprofen po (see pain, chapter 1). infections extending into the cervico-facial tissues extremely serious cellulitis, with rapidly spreading cervical or facial tissue necrosis and signs of septicaemia. treatment: treatment in an intensive care unit. high dose antibiotic treatment (see necrotising infections of the skin and soft tissues). extraction of the tooth. page 35 9/ 409chapter 11: mental disorders in adults anxiety insomnia agitation acute confusional state (delirium) post-traumatic stress disorder depression psychotic disorders acute psychotic episode chronic psychoses bipolar disorder page 36 0/ 409anxiety last updated: november 2021 a patient suffering from anxiety has: psychological symptoms: pervasive worries, e.g. fear of having a serious illness, fear with no clearly-defined object or phobias; behavioural changes: nervousness, avoidance behaviour, self-isolating tendency, irritability; physical symptoms: e.g. dry mouth, “lump in the throat”; sometimes medically unexplained symptoms (e.g. feeling of malaise, hot flashes or chills, diffuse pain); concentration difficulties, sleep problems (difficulty getting to sleep, recurrent nightmares). anxiety is a common feature in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis. it can also occur in isolation, not associated with any other mental disorders. anxiety symptoms often occur immediately after a difficult life event. medically unexplained symptoms are frequent in refugees and people exposed to adversity; in certain cultures they may be the only expression of psychological distress. management try to determine the source of the anxiety and reassure the patient (without minimising the distress or symptoms). if necessary, use simple relaxation techniques to alleviate the symptoms a . if symptoms are exacerbated (e.g., tachycardia, feeling of suffocation, fear of dying or “going crazy,” agitation, or conversely, prostration), it may be necessary to administer diazepam: 5 to 10 mg po or 10 mg im, to be repeated after one hour if required. acute severe anxiety may justify a short course (max. 2 or 3 weeks) of: diazepam po: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily; reducing the dose by half in the last few days of treatment moderate anxiety lasting more than 2 weeks, administer as first-line treatment: hydroxyzine po: 25 to 50 mg 2 times daily (max. 100 mg daily) or, only if there is no improvement after 1 week, diazepam po: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily for max. 2 weeks. if symptoms recur after treatment discontinuation, do not resume diazepam or hydroxyzine. re-evaluate for possible depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. for generalised anxiety that lasts more than 2 months, and does not improve with psychosocial interventions, an antidepressant should be prescribed (fluoxetine or paroxetine po: 20 mg once daily), to be continued for 2 to 3 months after symptoms resolve then, stop gradually over 2 weeks. footnotes (a) for example, in case of hyperventilation, use a technique that controls the respiratory rate: get the patient in a comfortable position with his eyes closed. help him focus on his breathing so that it becomes calmer and more regular, with three-phase breathing cycles: inhalation (count to three), exhalation (count to three), pause (count to three), etc. page 36 1/ 409insomnia last updated: november 2021 complaints may be: difficulty falling or remaining asleep, waking up too early in the morning, nightmares, or fatigue. symptoms occur at least three times a week for at least one month. management if insomnia is related to an organic cause, treat the cause (e.g. administer analgesics for pain). a if insomnia is related to the use of alcohol, drugs or a medication , management depends on the substance involved. if insomnia is related to a particular life event (e.g. bereavement), a short term treatment with a sedative may be useful: promethazine po: 25 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 to 10 days or, if promethazine is not available, hydroxyzine po: 25 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 to 10 days or, as a last resort (risk of addiction), diazepam po: 2 to 5 mg once daily at bedtime for 7 days max. if insomnia persists, re-evaluate the patient. insomnia is a common feature in depression (depression), post-traumatic stress disorder (post-traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety disorders (anxiety). in such cases, the underlying disorder should be addressed. footnotes (a) the main drugs known to cause sleep problems are corticosteroids, beta blockers, levodopa/carbidopa, fluoxetine, levothyroxine, etc. page 36 2/ 409agitation last updated: november 2021 people who have recently experienced violent events, or with anxiety, depression, psychotic disorders or delirium, may have periods of psychomotor agitation. agitation is common in acute intoxication (alcohol/psychostimulant drugs) and withdrawal syndrome. certain drugs may cause agitation (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), levodopa, mefloquine, efavirenz, etc.). agitation may be accompanied by oppositional, violent or fleeing behaviour. management clinical evaluation is best performed in pairs, in a calm setting, with or without the person’s family/friends, depending on the situation. it is essential to check for signs of delirium. if present, the priority is to identify the cause and treat it (see acute confusional state). it may be necessary to administer diazepam 10 mg po to reduce the agitation and conduct the clinical exam, without over-sedating the patient. if the patient is violent or dangerous, urgent sedation is required: diazepam im 10 mg, to be repeated after 30 to 60 minutes if necessary. physical restraint should only be used in certain circumstances, strictly following the procedure in place. avoid diazepam if agitation is related to acute alcohol intoxication or in case of delirium (risk of respiratory depression). use haloperidol (see acute confusional state). alcoholic patients can experience withdrawal symptoms within 6 to 24 hours after they stop drinking. withdrawal syndrome should be taken into consideration in patients who are hospitalised and therefore forced to stop drinking abruptly. in the early phase (pre-delirium tremens), the symptoms include irritability, a general feeling of malaise, profuse sweating and shaking. treatment consists in: diazepam po (10 mg every 6 hours for 1 to 3 days, then reduce and stop over 7 days) + oral hydration (3 litres of water daily) + thiamine im or very slow iv (100 mg 3 times daily for at least 3 days) if the agitation is associated with anxiety, see anxiety; if associated with psychotic disorders, see psychotic disorders. page 36 3/ 409acute confusional state (delirium) last updated: july 2022 clinical features the clinical picture includes: disorientation in time and space; impaired consciousness; concentration problems; memory impairment. these symptoms develop rapidly (hours or days), and often fluctuate during the course of the day. agitation, delusions, behavioural disorders and hallucinations (often visual) may be associated symptoms. management delirium almost always has an organic cause: infectious: meningitis, severe malaria, encephalitis, septicaemia, syphilis, aids, etc. metabolic: hyper/hypoglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance, niacin (vitamin pp or b ) or thiamine (vitamin b ) 3 1 deficiencies, etc. endocrine: thyroid disorders neurological: epilepsy, raised intracranial pressure, head trauma, meningeal haemorrhage, brain tumour, etc. also consider the use of drugs which may cause delirium (opioid analgesics, psychotropic drugs, fluoroquinolones, etc.), use of toxic substances (alcohol/drugs), or withdrawal from these substances. delirium requires hospitalisation. treat the underlying cause. provide supportive care (i.e. nutrition, fluid, electrolyte balance); ensure bladder function. ensure that the patient receives only medications appropriate to their needs. treat pain if needed (see pain, chapter 1); ensure adequate sensory environment: low lightening, limit noise. the administration of diazepam may increase delirium. if it is absolutely necessary to sedate an agitated patient, use low dose haloperidol for a short time (7 days or less): haloperidol po: 0.5 to 1 mg 2 times daily or haloperidol im: 0.5 to 1 mg, to be repeated if the patient is still agitated 30 to 60 minutes after the first injection. if necessary, administer additional doses every 4 hours, do not exceed a total dose of 5 mg daily. in case of delirium related to alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens): admit the patient to an intensive care unit. administer diazepam iv: 10 to 20 mg 4 to 6 times daily, under close supervision with ventilation equipment near at hand. the goal is to achieve mild sedation without provoking respiratory depression. the doses and duration of the treatment are adjusted according to the clinical progress. iv hydration: 2 to 4 litres 0.9% sodium chloride per 24 hours. administer thiamine im or very slow iv (over 30 minutes): 100 mg 3 times daily for 3 to 5 days. monitor vital signs and blood glucose levels. page 36 4/ 409post-traumatic stress disorder last updated: november 2021 an event is “traumatic” when someone has been directly confronted with death, either by seeing another person being killed or seriously injured as the result of violence, or by experiencing serious harm, such as a threat to his/her life or physical integrity (e.g. rape, torture). exposure to one or several of these events causes feelings of helplessness and horror. immediate, transitory symptoms (disorientation, anxiety, sadness, fleeing, etc.) are to be distinguished from secondary, long-lasting problems that appear and/or last several weeks or months after the event: post-traumatic stress, often associated with depression (depression), or sometimes acute psychosis (psychotic disorders), even in people with no history of psychotic symptoms. post-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by three types of psychological response, generally seen in combination [1] . persistent re-experiencing the patient describes: images, thoughts or perceptions related to the traumatic experience, which intrude despite efforts to block them out, including at night in the form of distressing dreams; flashbacks during which the patient “relives” parts of the traumatic scene. avoidance the patient tries to avoid: places, situations and people that might be associated with the trauma; having thoughts or feelings related to the trauma; patients may use alcohol, drugs or any psychotropic agents for this purpose. persistent perceptions of heightened current threat hypervigilance (constant state of alert), exaggerated startle reaction, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration; sometimes somatic symptoms (sweating, shaking, tachycardia, headache, etc.). re-experiencing is highly distressing and causes disorders that may worsen over time; people isolate themselves, behave differently, stop fulfilling their family/social obligations, and experience diffuse pain and mental exhaustion. management psychological intervention is essential to reduce the suffering, disabling symptoms and social handicaps resulting from ptsd. it is important to reassure the patient that their symptoms are a normal response to an abnormal event. sessions should be conducted with tact. the patient should be listened to. avoid intensely questioning the patient about their emotions: leave it to the patient to decide how far they want to go. associated symptoms (anxiety or insomnia), if persistent, can be relieved by symptomatic treatment (see anxiety and insomnia) for no more than two weeks. if the patient has severe symptoms (obsessive thoughts, pronounced hypervigilance, comorbid despression etc.), the pharmacological treatment is fluoxetine po (20 mg once daily) or paroxetine po (10 to 20 mg once daily) or sertraline po (50 mg once daily), to be continued for 2 to 3 months after symptoms resolve then, stop gradually. page 36 5/ 409references 1. world health organization. post traumatic stress disorder. international classification of diseases for mortality and morbidity statistics, eleventh revision (icd-11). https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2070699808 [accessed 26 january 2021] page 36 6/ 409depression last updated: july 2022 depression is characterised by a set of symptoms that have been present at least two weeks and represent a change from previous functioning. the standard criteria for diagnosis of major depressive disorder are: pervasive sadness and/or a lack of interest or pleasure in activities normally found pleasurable and at least four of the following signs: significant change in appetite or weight insomnia, especially early waking (or, more rarely, hypersomnia) psychomotor agitation or retardation significant fatigue, making it difficult to carry out daily tasks diminished ability to make decisions or concentrate feelings of guilt or worthlessness, loss of self-confidence or self-esteem feelings of despair thoughts of death, suicidal ideation or attempt the features of depression can vary according to the patient’s culture a . for example, the depressed patient may express multiple somatic complaints rather than psychological distress. depression may also manifest itself as an acute psychotic disorder in a given cultural context. management when faced with symptoms of depression, consider an underlying organic cause (e.g. hypothyroidism or parkinson’s disease) or adverse effects from medical treatment (corticosteroids, cycloserine, efavirenz, mefloquine, etc.). look for a triggering event (e.g. sexual violence, recent childbirth and post-partum depression). depressive disorders are the most common mental disorders in patients with severe chronic infectious diseases such as hiv infection or tuberculosis. these disorders should not be neglected, especially as they have a negative impact on adherence to treatment. symptoms of depression are common after a major loss (bereavement, forced displacement, etc.). they gradually subside, in most cases, with social support. psychological support may be useful. pharmacological treatment should always be offered, along with counseling, to patients with severe depression (patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) score > 19; severe functional impairment, psychotic symptoms, and/or suicidal risk). in patients with moderately severe depression (phq-9 score 15-19), pharmacological treatment should be considered if there is no improvement after 3 counselling sessions, or from the outset if patients express a personal preference for it. before prescribing, make sure that 9-month treatment and follow-up (psychological support, adherence and response) are possible. page 36 7/ 409preferably use a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sri), particularly in older patients. preferably use fluoxetine, except during pregnancy when sertraline is preferred. fluoxetine po: 20 mg on alternate days for one week, then once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 40 mg daily); use with caution in patients with severe anxiety disorders or who are immobilised (e.g. wounded) or paroxetine po: 10 mg once daily for 3 days, then 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 40 mg daily), especially if the depression is accompanied by severe anxiety or sertraline po: 25 mg once daily for 3 days, then 50 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 100 mg daily) assess tolerance and response every week for 4 weeks. if the response is inadequate after 4 weeks at optimal dose or if the sri is poorly tolerated, replace with another sri (there is no need for a medication-free interval between the two). if sris are not available, amitriptyline po may be used as an alternative: start with 25 mg once daily at bedtime and gradually increase over 8 to 10 days to 75 mg once daily (max. 150 mg daily). the therapeutic dose is close to the lethal dose; in older patients, reduce the dose by half. there is a delay of 2 to 3 weeks before the antidepressant effect of sris occurs, at least 4 weeks for amitriptyline. during this period, anxiety may be exacerbated and the risk of suicide may increase, especially with fluoxetine. hydroxyzine po (25 to 50 mg 2 times daily, max 100 mg daily) or promethazine po (25 to 50 mg once daily at bedtime) may be given for the first 2 weeks of treatment. if there is no improvement after 1 week, change to diazepam po (2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily) for 2 weeks max. during the first 2 to 4 weeks, do not give the patient more tablets than the quantity required for each week or entrust the treatment to someone in the patient's close entourage that can initially ensure administration of the drug. severe depression carries the risk of suicide. talking to patients about this will not increase the risk of suicide attempt. on the contrary – depressed people are often anxious and ambivalent about suicide and feel relieved when able to talk about it. if major symptoms have not improved after a month of treatment, increase to the maximum dose and assess after 2 weeks. if there is no improvement, refer the patient to a psychiatrist, if possible; if not, try a different antidepressant. the treatment should always be stopped gradually over a 4-week period. inform the patient about problems associated with abrupt treatment discontinuation (very common with paroxetine). special situations: pregnant or breast-feeding women pregnancy in a woman under antidepressants: re-evaluate the need to continue treatment. if treatment is still necessary, it is best to continue a treatment that has been effective rather than switching to a different antidepressant. nevertheless, if the woman plans to breastfeed and is taking fluoxetine, consider switching to another sri at least 3 weeks before expected delivery to reduce adverse effects in the neonate during breastfeeding. monitor the neonate the first few days of life for signs of toxicity or withdrawal symptoms. depression occurring during pregnancy or during post-partum period: depression is more frequent in the post-partum (breast-feeding) period than in pregnancy. in case of severe post- partum depression in a breast-feeding woman: use sertraline as first-line option, or if not available, use paroxetine: do not administer fluoxetine. in case of severe depression during pregnancy: use sertraline, avoid paroxetine. footnotes page 36 8/ 409(a) hence the importance of working with an “informant” (in the anthropological sense of the word) when dealing with unfamiliar cultural contexts. page 36 9/ 409psychotic disorders acute psychotic episode chronic psychoses bipolar disorder last updated: july 2022 psychoses are characterised by delusions (the patient is convinced of things that are not real and not accounted for by the person’s cultural background), or hallucinations (the patient hears voices that do not exist) and behavioural symptoms (e.g. strange behaviour, agitation, mutism, opposition, fleeing). management includes psychosocial support and antipsychotic medication. treatment efficacy and prognosis depend largely on the quality of the therapeutic relationship established with the patient and their family. keeping the patient at home with outpatient follow-up is preferred if there is no risk of self-harm or harm to others, and if the family is capable of managing the disorder. interpretation of psychotic symptoms vary according to the cultural context a . for example, psychotic disorders may be attributed to charms or to ancestor intervention. therapeutic approach should take those beliefs into account. patients are usually already under “traditional” treatments, this should not be seen as an obstacle to conventional medical treatment. footnotes (a) hence the importance of working with an “informant” (in the anthropological sense of the word) when dealing with unfamiliar cultural contexts. page 37 0/ 409acute psychotic episode last updated: july 2022 an acute psychotic episode can be a one-time occurrence, usually of sudden onset, or can occur repeatedly, or it may be the early phase of chronic psychosis. it can occur following an adverse life event (e.g. loss, acute stress or trauma). in postpartum psychosis, delusions are frequently related to the mother-child relationship. before prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see acute confusional state (delirium)) or substance use; check and record blood pressure, heart rate, weight. antipsychotic treatment is the same as for chronic psychoses (haloperidol or risperidone) and should last at least 3 months. after 3 months, if the patient is stable, stop the treatment gradually over 4 weeks, monitoring for potential relapse. if the acute episode lasted more than 3 months, continue antipsychotic treatment for at least 2 years. for severe anxiety or agitation, a short-course anxiolytic or sedative treatment may be added to the antipsychotic treatment, at the beginning of treatment. page 37 1/ 409chronic psychoses last updated: july 2022 chronic psychoses (schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, etc.) are defined by specific clinical characteristics and their long-term nature. schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, disorganized thinking, hallucinations, depersonalisation, loss of motivation, diminished emotional expression, impaired cognition, abnormal behaviour and neglected hygiene. such patients are often very anxious. the goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and improve social and occupational functioning. it offers real benefits, even if chronic symptoms persist (tendency toward social isolation, possible relapses and periods of increased behavioural problems, etc.). before prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see acute confusional state (delirium)) and use of substances. check and record blood pressure, heart rate and weight. treatment should last at least one year, possibly for life, particularly in patients with schizophrenia. uncertainty about the possibility of follow-up at one year or beyond is no reason not to treat. however, it is better not to start pharmacological treatment for patients who have no family/social support (e.g. homeless), provided they do not have severe behavioural disorders. only prescribe one antipsychotic at a time. to limit the risk of adverse effects, start treatment at a low dose and gradually increase until the minimum effective dose is reached. in older patients, reduce the dose by half, whichever medication is used. haloperidol is the first-line antipsychotic. preferably use oral haloperidol with a view to switching to long-acting haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate) if the patient is likely to need long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia). haloperidol po: start with 0.5 mg 2 times daily for 3 days then 1 mg 2 times daily until the end of the first week; increase to 2.5 mg 2 times daily the second week. after 2 weeks, assess if the treatment is well tolerated and effective. if it is not effective, check adherence; if necessary increase to 5 mg 2 times daily (max. 15 mg daily). if haloperidol is not available, contraindicated or poorly tolerated, possible alternative are: risperidone po: 1 mg 2 times daily for one week, then 2 mg 2 times daily for one week; if necessary, increase to 3 mg 2 times daily as of the third week (max. 10 mg daily). or chlorpromazine po (especially if a sedative effect is required): 25 to 50 mg once daily in the evening for one week; if necessary, increase to 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening for one week; if necessary, 100 mg 3 times daily as of the third week. or olanzapine po: 10 mg once daily; if necessary, increase by 5 mg every week (max. 20 mg daily). in case of extrapyramidal symptoms, try reducing the dose of antipsychotic or, if the extrapyramidal symptoms are severe, add biperiden po: 2 mg once daily, increase if necessary up to 2 mg 2 to 3 times daily (if biperiden is not available, use trihexyphenidyl po at the same dosage). for severe anxiety, it is possible to add a short-course anxiolytic treatment (for a few days to max. 2 to 3 weeks) to the antipsychotic treatment: diazepam po: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily for major agitation: page 37 2/ 409if the patient is not under antipsychotic treatment: haloperidol po 5 mg + promethazine po 25 mg, to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary. after a further 60 minutes, if necessary administer promethazine im 50 mg. in case of hostile or agressive behaviour, use im route (same dose), to be repeated after 30 minutes if necessary; after a further 30 minutes, if necessary, administer promethazine im 50 mg. high doses of haloperidol can induce extrapyramidal symptoms, add biperiden if necessary. if the patient is already under antipsychotic treatment: diazepam po or im: 10 mg to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary do not combine two antipsychotics. for long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia) a long-acting antipsychotic drug can be used once the patient has been stabilised on oral treatment. the dosage depends on the oral dose the patient is taking. the switch from oral to a long-acting antipsychotic should be gradual, according to a specific protocol. for information, at the end of the transition period from oral to long-acting antipsychotic, the dose of haloperidol decanoate im administered every 3 to 4 weeks is approximately: daily dose monthly dose of of haloperidol po haloperidol decanoate im (a) 2.5 mg 25 mg 5 mg 50 mg 10 mg 100 mg 15 mg 150 mg (a) if haloperidol decanoate is not available, fluphenazine im: 12.5 to 50 mg/injection every 3 to 4 weeks. for a patient on risperidone po: gradually decrease the dose of risperidone by slowly introducing haloperidol po then, once the patient is stabilised, change to haloperidol decanoate every 3 to 4 weeks as above. special situations: pregnant or breast-feeding women in the event of pregnancy in a woman taking antipsychotics: re-evaluate the need to continue the treatment. if treatment is still necessary, administer the minimal effective dose and avoid combination with an anticholinergic (biperiden or trihexphenidyl). monitor the neonate for extrapyramidal symptoms during the first few days of life. first symptoms of psychosis during pregnancy: start with the lowest dose of haloperidol and only increase slowly if necessary. post-partum psychosis: if the woman is breast-feeding, haloperidol should be preferred. long-acting antipsychotics should not be administered. page 37 3/ 409bipolar disorder last updated: july 2022 bipolar disorder is characterised by alternating manic and depressive episodes a , generally separated by “normal” periods lasting several months or years. episodes of mania are characterised by elation, euphoria and hyperactivity accompanied by insomnia, grandiose ideas, and loss of social inhibitions (sexual, in particular). depressive episodes are often severe, with significant risk of suicide. look for family history of similar symptoms (particularly suicide), very frequent in bipolar patients. pharmacological treatment: episodes of mania are treated with haloperidol po: 5 mg once daily for 3 days, then 7.5 mg for one week; if necessary, increase by increments of 2.5 mg per week (max. 15 mg daily). possible alternatives: risperidone po: 2 mg once daily; if necessary, increase in increments of 1 mg per week (max. 6 mg daily). or olanzapine po: 10 mg once daily for 3 days; if necessary, increase in increments of 5 mg per week (max. 20 mg daily). if there is improvement after one week of treatment, continue with the same dose for at least 8 weeks after remission of symptoms. diazepam po (5 to 10 mg daily) can be added during the first 2 to 3 weeks. if symptoms do not resolve after 2 weeks of antipsychotic treatment at maximum tolerated dose (and 2 different antipsychotics have been tried), add a mood stabiliser: valproic acid po: 200 mg 2 times daily (week 1) then 400 mg 2 times daily (week 2) then 500 mg 2 times daily (week 3). this is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 500 mg weekly (max. 1000 mg 2 times daily). or carbamazepine po: 100 mg 2 times daily (week 1) then 200 mg 2 times daily (week 2) then 200 mg 3 times daily (week 3). this is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 200 mg weekly (max. 1200 mg daily). treatment should be continued until at least 8 weeks after complete remission of symptoms. assess together with the patient the benefits and risks of pursuing long-term treatment. if is it decided to discontinue antipsychotic treatment, medication should be stopped gradually, monitoring for possible relapse. depressive episodes are treated as for depression (see depression). if the patient has an episode of mania while on antidepressants, immediately stop antidepressants and treat the episode of mania as above. an episode of mania while on antidepressants is indicative of bipolar disorder. long-term treatment for bipolar disorder is based on continuation of the treatment that led to the remission of the manic episode: antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, or a combination of both. treatment can be initiated by a physician trained in mental health, but a consultation should be set up as soon as possible with a specialist. page 37 4/ 409valproic acid is not recommended in women of childbearing age. if it is necessary to start treatment, use carbamazepine. if a woman of childbearing age is already taking valproic acid, switch to carbamazepine by gradually decreasing the dose of valproic acid over a period of 2 weeks (do not stop treatment abruptly) while gradually starting carbamazepine. if a woman becomes pregnant or is planning pregnancy it is essential to contact a specialist to re-evaluate whether the treatment is still necessary and adjust the dose if needed. footnotes (a) “unipolar forms” are characterized by recurring episodes of depression. page 37 5/ 409chapter 12: other conditions sickle cell disease epilepsy diabetes type 2 in adults essential hypertension in adults heart failure in adults chronic heart failure acute heart failure (acute pulmonary oedema) endemic goitre and iodine deficiency page 37 6/ 409sickle cell disease homozygous sickle cell disease (scd) is a life-threatening genetic disorder of haemoglobin (hb). the abnormal hb (hbs) results in the distortion of red blood cells into a sickle shape leading to increased destruction (haemolysis), an increase in blood viscosity and obstruction of capillaries (vaso-occlusion). scd is common in sub-saharan africa (1 to 3% of births), on the american continent, in india and in the mediterranean basin. clinical features symptoms generally begin after 6 months of age. major signs: recurrent painful crises, chronic anaemia, splenomegaly and frequently, growth retardation and malnutrition in children. serious acute life threatening complications such as stroke, overwhelming infections and acute chest syndrome. in populations in whom the disease is frequent, diagnosis is suggested by a family history of similar clinical signs. major acute manifestations painful vaso-occlusive crises (voc) children under 2 years present with the hand-foot syndrome or dactylitis (acute pain and swelling in the hands or feet). children older than 2 years and adults present with acute pain affecting the back, chest, abdomen (can resemble an acute abdomen) and extremities. young children may have non-specific signs of a voc: refusal to walk, irritability, lack of appetite, crying, whimpering or moaning when touched, etc. look for an associated infection that might have precipitated the voc. in case of bony pain in a single location, unresponsive to analgesics (or a persistent limp in a child) associated with fever and erythema or swelling, consider an osteomyelitis. fever look for infection: in particular pneumonia, cellulitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis and sepsis (patients are particularly susceptible to infections especially due to pneumococcus, meningococcus and haemophilus influenzae); malaria. acute severe anaemia the chronic anaemia is often complicated by acute severe anaemia with gradually appearing fatigue, pallor of the conjunctivae and palms, shortness of breath, tachycardia, syncope or heart failure. the acute anaemia can be due to: acute severe haemolysis often secondary to malaria: fever, haemoglobinuria (dark urine) and yellow conjunctivae. splenic sequestration (trapping of blood cells in the spleen), mostly in children 1 to 4 years: sudden enlargement of the spleen, severe left upper quadrant pain, thrombocytopenia. can lead to shock. aplastic crisis (transient suspension of red blood cell production by the bone marrow): impalpable spleen and absence of reticulocytes. stroke page 37 7/ 409most often ischaemic (due to vaso-occlusion in cerebral vessels) but a stroke can also be haemorrhagic. sudden loss of motor function or aphasia, in children and in adults. signs can resemble meningitis and cerebral malaria: headache, photophobia, vomiting, stiff neck, alteration of consciousness and neurologic signs or rarely seizures. acute chest syndrome (acs) chest pain, tachypnoea, respiratory distress, hypoxia;

myoclonic seizures: sudden and brief contractions of a muscle or group of muscles; atonic seizures: sudden loss of muscle tone, frequently resulting in falls; absence seizures: brief (a few seconds) impairment of consciousness and cessation of activity; most common in children from 4 years of age. focal onset seizures start with localised symptoms (e.g. jerking movements of one body part or repetitive lips smacking) and sometimes spread to the rest of the body, becoming generalised. epilepsy is clinically diagnosed when 2 or more "unprovoked" seizures (i.e. seizures not caused by a temporary reversible condition) of any type occur more than 24 hours apart [2] [3] . treatment principles once the diagnosis of epilepsy (or seizures requiring long-term treatment) has been made, an antiseizure medication (asm) is prescribed to prevent the occurrence of new seizures. the treatment prescribed should be a monotherapy (i.e. a single asm). for choosing an asm, see choice of an antiseizure medication. the likelihood of continued asm availability should also be considered when making the choice. treatment should be taken daily without interruption for the long term. abruptly stopping or reducing an asm dose is likely to provoke seizures. long-term patient follow-up is required, see patient follow-up. any change in treatment (dose increments, asm substitution or discontinuation) requires close clinical monitoring. rarely, asms may cause a paradoxical increase in seizure frequency, mainly at the start of treatment or after an increase in dose. if seizures are not controlled, assess adherence to treatment, consider increasing the dose if tolerated, up to the maximum dose if necessary. page 38 4/ 409if seizures are still not controlled or treatment is not tolerated, gradually change to another asm (slowly increase the dose of the new asm then slowly decrease the dose of the first asm until complete substitution). combination therapy should be considered only if two different asms used in monotherapy have failed. stopping an antiseizure treatment may be considered when the patient has been seizure-free for at least 2 years [4] . the benefits/risks of stopping the asm should be discussed with the patient (seizures may recur after stopping treatment). the dose should be slowly tapered (e.g. by 10% every 2 weeks) over a period of at least 3 months. patients should seek medical attention if seizures recur during or after stopping treatment. patient and family education is essential. provide information about epilepsy as a disease, the benefits of treatment, ways to maximize control (including adherence to treatment) and first aid for seizures. explain that people with epilepsy can lead normal lives when certain safety measures are taken (e.g. not swimming alone, not cooking over open flames) [4] [5] . choice of an antiseizure medication an asm is selected according to: the type of seizure: some asms may exacerbate some symptoms, the patient’s characteristics: age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, comorbidities, and related treatments, the asm’s adverse effect profile: in general, newer asms (e.g. levetiracetam) are safer, better tolerated, and have fewer drug interactions than older asms (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid). age/type of seizures first choice second choice third choice children 1 month to < 2 years motor, generalised carbamazepine (cbz) levetiracetam (lev) phenobarbital (pb) (tonic-clonic, myoclonic (a) , atonic (b) ) or phenytoin (pht) non-motor, generalised (absence) – – – focal (partial) lev or cbz pb or pht – girls 2 to < 10 years, boys ≥ 2 years and men motor, generalised lev or cbz or pb – (tonic-clonic, myoclonic (a) , atonic (b) ) valproic acid (vpa) or pht non-motor, generalised (absence (c) ) lev or vpa – – focal (partial) lev or cbz vpa pb or pht girls ≥ 10 years and women motor, generalised lev cbz or pht pb (tonic-clonic, myoclonics (a) , atonic (b) ) non-motoras, generalised (absence (c) ) lev – – focal (partial) lev cbz or pht pb page 38 5/ 409(a) for myoclonic seizures: cbz and pht are not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms). (b) for atonic seizures: cbz is not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms). (c) for absence seizures: cbz, pb and pht are not recommended (risk of worsening symptoms). children vpa is contraindicated in children less than 2 years (increased risk of hepatotoxicity). patients over 65 years lev is preferred in older patients [6] . pregnant women and girls the risk of major congenital malformations (mcm) is lower with monotherapy than with combined therapy [7] . asms that can be used during pregnancy include: lev: first-line, safest asm with the lowest risk of mcm [7] [8] . asms other than lev (only if lev is not available): cbz and pht: associated with an intermediate risk of mcm [7] [8] ; pb: associated with a high risk of mcm [7] [8] and small for gestational age. if taking asm treatment before pregnancy: lev: continue treatment under closer monitoring. asms other than lev: the benefits/risks of substitution for a safer asm should be discussed with patients. substitution may be beneficial for the foetus but may also be a risk for the mother and the foetus if it results in loss of seizure control. the term of pregnancy should be taken into account. for substitution with a safer asm, see treatment principles. a substitution frequently takes 2 to 3 months. vpa must not be prescribed in pregnant women and girls. it is associated with the highest risk of mcm and neurodevelopmental disorders in children exposed in utero [7] [8] . in situations where vpa would be the only option, divide doses over the day to minimize peaks in vpa plasma concentrations. in all cases: the parents should be informed of current knowledge in terms of risks for the unborn child, in particular when the risk of foetotoxicity is high. administer the lower effective dose (foetal harms are mainly dose-dependent). asm plasma concentrations may decrease during pregnancy. if the dose needs to be increased antepartum, start reducing it from d3-d4 postpartum to gradually return to the dose effective before pregnancy. start taking high dose folic acid to reduce the risk of mcm (5 mg daily for the first trimester [9] a ). after pregnancy, the benefits of breastfeeding are considered to outweigh the risk of adverse effects of asms [10] . women and girls of childbearing age the choice of an asm is based on the same criteria as per pregnant women and girls due to the possibility of undiagnosed or future pregnancies. preconception and/or contraception counselling should be offered. if considering pregnancy, depending on the asm currently taken, consider a safer asm. when planning pregnancy, start taking folic acid before conception to reduce the risk of mcm. if no pregnancy is planned, effective contraception should be provided: patient taking cbz, pb or pht: injectable medroxyprogesterone (dmpa) or levonorgestrel-containing or copper intrauterine device [7] . patient taking lev or vpa: as above, but contraceptive implants and oral contraceptives can also be used [7] . page 38 6/ 409in situations where vpa would be the only effective option (i.e. after confirmation that other asms are ineffective or poorly tolerated), a blood pregnancy test should be performed before starting the treatment, then regularly if the patient is not on effective contraception. if pregnancy occurs, see pregnant women and girls. dosage of antiseizure medications start with a low dose then increase gradually based on patient's response (seizure control) and tolerance (occurrence of adverse effects). the following doses are given as a guide and should be ajusted individually. carbamazepine po: children 1 month to 11 years: start with 5 mg/kg once daily or 2.5 mg/kg 2 times daily;

[1] type 2 diabetes can lead to acute complications, as well as chronic complications that result in serious organ damage (cardiovascular events; diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy). clinical features few or no symptoms; symptoms of hyperglycaemia may be present: polyuria (frequent urination) and polydypsia (excessive thirst and drinking). in rare cases, patients may present with severe hyperglycaemia (impaired consciousness, coma or acute dehydration). diagnosis look for diabetes in the event of: symptoms of hyperglycaemia; cardiovascular disorders: stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension; peripheral neuropathies, foot ulcers, absence of tendon reflexes or peripheral pulse. diagnosis is made on one of the following results a [1] [2] : tests symptomatic patient asymptomatic patient fasting blood glucose (a) 1 fasting blood glucose 2 fasting blood glucose ≥ 7 mmol/litre (≥ 126 mg/dl) ≥ 7 mmol/litre (≥ 126 mg/dl) random blood glucose (b) 1 random blood glucose see tablenote (b) ≥ 11 mmol/litre (≥ 200 mg/dl) post-load blood glucose (c) 1 post-load blood glucose: 2 post-load blood glucose: on venous blood on venous blood ≥ 11 mmol/litre (≥ 200 mg/dl) ≥ 11 mmol/litre (≥ 200 mg/dl) or or on capillary blood on capillary blood ≥ 12.2 mmol/litre (≥ 220 mg/dl) ≥ 12.2 mmol/litre (≥ 220 mg/dl) glycated hb (hba1c) (d) 1 hba1c ≥ 6.5% 2 hba1c ≥ 6.5% (a) fasting blood glucose test: performed on patient that has fasted at least 8 hours. values are the same for venous and capillary blood. (b) random blood glucose test: performed at any moment of the day. values are for venous blood only. for asymptomatic patients, it is not recommended to perform 2 random blood glucose tests. if the first test is a random blood glucose, the second test should be a fasting blood glucose. (c) post-load blood glucose test: performed 2 hours after oral ingestion of 75 g glucose (one sachet of 75 g anhydrous glucose powder dissolved in 200 to 300 ml of water, to be drunk within 10 minutes). page 39 0/ 409(d) glycated haemoglobin (hba1c): reflects average glycaemia over around 3 months. perform urine dipstick analysis for ketones if: fasting blood glucose ≥ 15 mmol/litre (≥ 270 mg/dl) and symptoms of hyperglycemia, or fasting or random blood glucose ≥ 18 mmol/litre (≥ 325 mg/dl) even without symptoms. refer the patient if acute complications (such as hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis) are present. treatment glycaemic targets fasting blood glucose ≤ 7 mmol/litre (≤ 126 mg/dl) or hba1c of 7%. [3] the closer blood glucose levels remain to these values, the more cardiovascular complications are prevented or delayed. depending on the context (healthcare provision) or patient profile (older patient, history of severe hypoglycaemia or long-standing poorly controlled diabetes), hba1c ≤ 8% [2] is acceptable. blood glucose should not fall < 4.5 mmol/litre (or < 80 mg/dl) or hba1c < 6.5%. lifestyle and dietary advice b avoid sugared foods and drinks (but no excessive restriction of carbohydrates). high fibre intake; limit animal fats and alcohol. physical activity. weight control. if bmi ≥ 25, try to reduce weight by 5 to 10%. stop smoking. pharmacological treatment first-line treatment metformin po c . the usual dose is 1 to 2 g daily. for information: week 1: 500 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast week 2: 500 mg 2 times daily (morning and evening) during meals increase in increments of 500 mg per week as long as the drug is well tolerated (max. 2 g daily, i.e. 1 g morning and evening). if glycaemic control is not acheived, administer metformin in combination with a sulfonylurea. sulfonylurea doses are adjusted in increments to avoid the risk of hypoglycaemia, based on blood glucose results. in patients under 60, glibenclamide po: the usual dose is 5 mg 2 times daily. for information: week 1: 2.5 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast week 2: 5 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast increase in increments of 2.5 mg weekly until fasting blood glucose reaches target levels (max.15 mg daily). in patients over 60, gliclazide po (immediate release tablet): the usual dose is 40 to 80 mg 2 times daily. for information: weeks 1 and 2: 40 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast increase in increments of 40 mg every 2 weeks (weeks 3 and 4: 80 mg once daily in the morning at breakfast) until fasting blood glucose reaches target levels (max. 240 mg daily, i.e. 120 mg morning and evening). page 39 1/ 409if glycaemic control is not acheived with the combination of metformin + a sulfonylurea, continue metformin but replace the sulfonylurea with intermediate-acting insulin sc: start with 0.2 iu/kg at bedtime. the dose is adjusted after measuring fasting blood glucose in the morning. once blood glucose levels have stabilized, test levels once weekly then after each consultation. doses of 1 iu/kg/day or more may be necessary to reach glycaemic targets. if the necessary dose is over 0.5 iu/kg/day, administer in 2 injections daily. adjustment of intermediate-acting insulin dosage based on blood glucose levels morning blood glucose action < 4 mmol/litre treat hypoglycaemia (see hypoglycaemia, chapter 1). (< 70 mg/dl) reduce daily dose of insulin by 2 to 4 units. maintain new dose for 4 days. check blood glucose after 4 days, readjust dose if glycaemic target has not been not reached. check blood glucose again after 4 days and repeat the process until glycaemic target is reached. ≥ 4 and < 7.2 mmol/litre do not change dose. (≥ 70 and < 130 mg/dl) ≥ 7.2 and < 11 mmol/litre increase daily dose of insulin by 2 units. (≥ 130 and < 200 mg/dl) check blood glucose after 4 days, readjust dose if glycaemic target has not been not reached. check blood glucose again after 4 days and repeat the process until glycaemic target is reached. ≥ 11 mmol/litre increase daily dose of insulin by 4 units. (≥ 200 mg/dl) check blood glucose after 4 days, readjust dose if glycaemic target has not been not reached. check blood glucose again after 4 days and repeat the process until glycaemic target is reached. perform urine dipstick analysis for ketones according to the criteria defined in the diagnosis section. example for a man weighing 79 kg: start with 16 iu per day (79 kg x 0.2 iu). on d4, blood glucose is 14.6 mmol/litre. add 4 iu (daily dose of insulin is 20 iu). on d8, blood glucose is 10.4 mmol/litre. add 2 iu (daily dose of insulin is 22 iu). on d12, blood glucose is 6.1 mmol/litre. glycaemic target is reached. surveillance and monitoring laboratory surveillance patients on oral hypoglycemic agents: blood glucose test once a month to begin with, then during monitoring visits. patients on insulin: fasting blood glucose test during the dose adjustment phase then, if possible, once weekly, once the insulin dose stabilised. hba1c if available: every 3 months, then every 6 months if well stabilised. page 39 2/ 409other necessary tests according to comorbidities and chronic complications. clinical monitoring routine consultations: check blood pressure (should remain < 140/80 mmhg) and weight, examine feet. consultations once a month for the first 6 months, then individualised frequency of consultations depending on the patient's characteristics (e.g. every 6 months if the diabetes is well controlled). annual check-up: check for cardiovascular and neurological complications, evaluate renal function (serum creatinine and proteinuria dipstick test), examination of teeth and gums. management of diabetes complications. patient education b lifestyle and dietary measures (diet, physical activity, etc.). patients on sulfonylurea or insulin therapy: signs of hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia and management. patients on insulin therapy: auto-administration (schedule, injection sites and techniques); storage of insulin. patients on insulin therapy or presenting hypoglycaemic episodes [3] : self-monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of doses at home using a glucometer. patients with sensory neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease: autoexamination of feet; prevention of foot lesions. footnotes (a) even in symptomatic patients, it is preferable to perform a second blood glucose test to confirm the result. (b) these measures concern all patients regardless of medication prescribed. they can be sufficient alone to normalize blood glucose levels in certain patients. (c) if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, replace with a sulfonylurea. references 1. world health organization. classification of diabetes mellitus. world health organization; 2019 [accessed october 19, 2023]. https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/325182 2. hearts d: diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes [accessed october 19, 2023]. https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/who-ucn-ncd-20.1 3. type 2 diabetes in adults: management | guidance | nice. published december 2, 2015 [accessed october 19, 2023]. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28 page 39 3/ 409essential hypertension in adults hypertension (or high blood pressure - hbp) is defined as elevated blood pressure (bp) at rest that persists over time i.e. measured 3 times during 3 separate consultations over a period of three months. essential hypertension is defined as hbp of undetermined cause (the large majority of cases). the global overall prevalence of hbp in adults aged 25 and over is around 40%. [1] serious complications of hbp can be acute (hypertensive encephalopathy, left-sided heart failure, acute renal failure) or delayed i.e. occur after a long period during which hbp has not been controlled (stroke, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, chronic renal impairment). for pregnancy-induced hypertension, see essential obstetric and newborn care, msf. clinical features hbp thresholds: blood pressure (bp) in mmhg hbp classification systolic (sbp) diastolic (dbp) mild 140 or over 90 or over moderate 160 or over 100 or over severe 180 or over 110 or over severe hbp is defined more by the presence of serious end-organ damage than the blood pressure reading: uncomplicated hypertensive crisis: sbp ≥ 180 and/or dbp ≥ 110 and some symptoms (moderate headaches, epistaxis, dizziness, tinnitus, eye floaters) but no signs of end-organ damage; hypertensive emergency: sbp ≥ 180 and/or dbp ≥ 110 and signs of end-organ damage: intense headaches, nausea/vomitting, confusion, seizures, coma in the event of hypertensive encephalopathy; dyspnoea, chest pain in the event of heart failure or cardiac ischaemia; rapid and/or irregular heart rate in the event of heart failure; anuria, oliguria in the event of renal impairment. history and clinical examination should look for: medications being taken that can cause or aggravate hbp; a focal neurological sign(s) suggestive of stroke; comorbidities and risk factors: heart failure, diabetes, renal impairment; excessive smoking or consumption of alcohol, excess weight (bmi ≥ 25), etc. paraclinical investigations blood test: ionogram (particularly serum potassium levels), serum creatinine. other necessary laboratory tests according to comorbidities (e.g. diabetes). page 39 4/ 409ecg and echocardiogram to look for signs of heart failure, coronary disease, or arrhythmia. long-term treatment the goal of treatment is to lower bp. target bp are: sbp < 140 and/or dbp < 90 sbp < 140 and/or dbp < 80 in diabetic patients sbp < 150 and/or dbp < 90 in patients aged > 80 years in patients with mild hbp (sbp ≥ 140 and/or dbp ≥ 90) without associated cardiovascular disorders or stroke or diabetes, start with lifestyle and dietary advice. pharmacological treatment is indicated in the following cases: sbp ≥ 160 and/or dbp ≥ 100; hbp associated with cardiovascular disorder, stroke or diabetes; hbp not controlled by lifestyle and dietary changes alone. lifestyle and dietary advice recommended for all hypertensive patients: reduce calorie and salt intake. regular physical activity. weight loss if bmi ≥ 25. stop smoking and alcohol consumption. pharmacological treatment start with a monotherapy. one of four classes of antihypertensive drugs can be chosen as first line treatment, according to the patient’s characteristics (e.g. age, contra-indications, etc.). for information: page 39 5/ 409patient with no comorbidities patient with comorbidities thiazide diuretic after a stroke: thiazide diuretic patient > 65 years: thiazide diuretic or calcium diabetic patient: channel blocker angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor or beta blocker if concomitant cardiovascular disorder patient with black skin: thiazide diuretic or calcium renal impairment: ace inhibitor channel blocker (avoid ace inhibitors) thiazide diuretic: hydrochlorothiazide po: 12.5 to 25 mg once daily in the morning (max. 25 mg daily) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor: enalapril po: start with 5 mg once daily. gradually increase, every 1 to 2 weeks, according to bp, up to 10 to 20 mg once daily (max. 40 mg daily). in elderly patients or patients taking a diuretic or patients with renal impairment: start with 2.5 mg once daily. calcium channel blocker: amlodipine po: 5 mg once daily. increase to 10 mg once daily if necessary (max. 10 mg daily). in elderly patients or patients with hepatic impairment: start with 2.5 mg once daily. beta-blocker: (contra-indicated in patients with asthma) bisoprolol po: 5 to 10 mg once daily in the morning do not stop treatment abruptly (risk of malaise, angina). in patients with no comorbidity start with a thiazide diuretic and check bp after 4 weeks of treatment. if the treatment has been correctly taken but there is no improvement after 4 weeks, add a second antihypertensive drug. after 4 weeks of bitherapy, reevaluate. if the patient’s bp remains too high, consider triple-therapy. in diabetic patients, if there is no improvement after 4 weeks of aec inhibitor treatment taken correctly, add a calcium channel blocker. in patients with a cardiac disorder (heart failure or coronary heart disease), bitherapy is usually necessary from the start (aec inhibitor + beta-blocker). surveillance and monitoring laboratory surveillance according to treatment (diuretic, aec inhibitor, etc.): ionogram and serum creatinine every 6 to 12 months. clinical monitoring consultations every 3 months (bp, weight), then every 6 months, then individualised frequency of consultations depending on the patient's characteristics. management of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes). patient education page 39 6/ 409lifestyle and dietary advice. treatment observance: do not stop treatment abruptly, particularly if taking beta blockers (risk of malaise, angina). consultation in the event of epistaxis, tinnitus, eye floaters; adverse effects of treatment (e.g. cough with aec inhibitors, erectile dysfunction with beta blockers, oedema with calcium channel blockers). treatment of hypertensive crisis uncomplicated hypertensive crisis most frequent. reassure the patient and prescribe rest. check bp a few days later to start or adapt treatment. hypertensive emergency treat in an intensive care unit. hypertensive encephalopathy: the aim is to reduce bp by 10 to 15% within the first hour and to not reduce it more than 25% during the first 24 hours. labetalol iv (contra-indicated in patients with asthma b : 20 mg over at least 1 minute. administer another dose after 10 minutes if bp has not decreased. if necessary, 40 mg doses are administered every 10 minutes until hypertension is controlled (max. 300 mg total dose). stroke: do not try to decrease bp during the first 3 days unless sbp is ≥ 220 and/or dbp ≥ 120 (in this event administer labetalol). acute pulmonary oedema: see acute heart failure. footnotes (a) consider secondary hypertension caused by medications being taken, mainly nsaid, corticosteroids, opioids, oral estroprogestogens, etc. treatment, in this event, consists in stopping or replacing the causative drug. (b) in patient with asthma, hydralazine iv: 5 to 10 mg diluted in 10 ml of 0,9% sodium chloride administered by slow iv, to be repeated after 20 to 30 minutes if necessary. references 1. world health organization. media center. high blood pressure: a public health problem, 2018. http://www.emro.who.int/media/world-health-day/public-health-problem-factsheet-2013.html [accessed 12 september 2018] page 39 7/ 409heart failure in adults heart failure (hf) is defined as the inability of the heart to maintain adequate cardiac output. it is a serious condition, particularly frequent in people over 70 years. there are two types: chronic hf: gradual onset of signs of hf; acute hf: sudden onset of life-threatening hf (cardiogenic acute pulmonary oedema or shock), in most cases in patients with known cardiopathy. chronic heart failure acute heart failure (acute pulmonary oedema) page 39 8/ 409chronic heart failure clinical features left-sided hf (left ventricle failure; most frequent form) fatigue and/or progressive onset of dyspnoea, occurs on exertion and then at rest, accentuated by the decubitus position, preventing the patient from lying down; peripheral oedema. right-sided hf (right ventricle failure) oedema of the lower limbs, hepatomegaly, jugular vein distention, hepatojugular reflux; ascites in advanced stages. global hf (failure of both ventricles) left and right-sided signs; right-sided signs are often the most prominent. evaluate severity of hf [1] : class i no limitation of physical activity. no symptoms during ordinary physical activity. slight limitation of physical activity. comfortable at rest. ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, class ii palpitation, dyspnoea. marked limitation of physical activity. comfortable at rest. less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, class iii palpitation, or dyspnoea. class iv unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. symptoms of heart failure at rest. identify causative or aggravating factors: coronary or valvular heart disease, hypertension, viral or toxic cardiopathy, pericarditis. anaemia, american trypanosomiasis, rheumatic fever, diabetes, thyroid disorder, drug/alcohol addiction. paraclinical investigations cardiac ultrasound: if available, method of choice to confirm cardiopathy. electrocardiogram (ecg): can diagnose left ventricular cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and/or left bundle branch block) or arrhythmia and particularly atrial fibrillation (af or afib) or signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction. chest x-ray: can exclude lung disease in patients with dyspnoea or can show cardiomegaly or pleural effusion (often bilateral) and alveolar-interstitial syndrome. blood test: full blood count, ionogram, serum creatinine. other necessary laboratory tests according to comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, thyroid disorder). treatment lifestyle and dietary advice reduce salt intake to limit fluid retention. normal fluid intake except in cases of very severe oedema. stop smoking. physical activity adapted to the patient’s capacity. page 39 9/ 409weight loss if bmi ≥ 25. treatment of fluid retention furosemide po: start with 20 mg once daily; increase if necessary, according to clinical response (certain patients need doses of 80 mg 1 to 2 times daily) then reduce once oedema decrease (20 to 40 mg once daily). the reabsorption of oedema can sometimes be slow, taking up to 2 to 3 weeks. the gradual worsening of hf may require an increase in dosage. lifelong treatment with diuretics is not always necessary. in the event of resistant oedema, add hydrochlorothiazide po (25 mg 1 to 2 times daily for a few days) but only in hospital settings and monitoring renal function. long-term (lifelong) treatment ace inhibitors are the first line treatment. start with low doses, especially in patients with hypotension, renal impairment, hyponatraemia. while increasing the dose monitor: drug tolerance (dry cough), blood pressure (the systolic bp should remain above > 90 mmhg), serum potassium and creatinine levels. in patients taking diuretics, reduce the dose of the diuretic if possible while introducing ace inhibitors (risk of hypotension if the patient is on high doses of diuretics). enalapril po: week 1: 2.5 mg once daily for 3 days then 5 mg once daily week 2: 10 mg once daily for 3 days then 20 mg once daily the effective dose is usually 20 mg once daily (or 10 mg 2 times daily). doses of 10 mg daily are sometimes enough; conversely, doses of 40 mg daily (maximum) are sometimes necessary. once the patient has been stable for at least 2 weeks taking ace inhibitors and in the absence of any contra- indications (asthma, hypotension, bradycardia, conduction disorders, particularly atrio-ventricular heart blocks), add a beta blocker. bisoprolol po: start with a low dose and gradually increase as long as the drug is well tolerated (monitor for signs of worsening hf, blood pressure, heart rate). week 1: 1.25 mg once daily week 2: 2.5 mg once daily week 3: 3.75 mg once daily weeks 4 to 8: 5 mg once daily if insufficient: weeks 9 to 12: 7.5 mg once daily as from week 13: 10 mg once daily (max. 10 mg daily) in the event of temporarily worsening hf, hypotension or bradycardia, readjust doses of associated treatments and reduce the dose of bisoprolol or gradually stop treatment (stopping abruptly can lead to acute deterioration of the patient’s condition). once the patient is stabilized, re-increase/recommence bisoprolol. other treatments antagonist of aldosterone: only if serum potassium levels and ecg can be monitored (risk of severe hyperkalaemia), add spironolactone po (25 mg once daily) to long-term treatment, particularly in cases of severe hf (classes iii and iv). nitrates: can be used in left-sided or global hf in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors (cough is not tolerated, renal impairment, severe hypotension). isosorbide dinitrate po: start with 5 to 40 mg 2 to 3 times daily and increase up to the effective dose, usually 15 to 120 mg daily. page 40 0/ 409digitalis glycosides: administer with caution, in intensive care unit (the therapeutic dose is close to the toxic dose), only in patients with af with rapid ventricular response confirmed by ecg: no visible p waves, irregularly irregular qrs complex (120-160). treatment of causative or aggravating factors according to the cause. surveillance and monitoring laboratory surveillance according to treatment (ace, diuretic, etc.). clinical monitoring once stabilised, consultations once a month for the first 6 months, then individualised frequency of consultations depending on the patient's characteristics. routine consultations: weight curve, bp, progress of signs (dyspnoea, oedema, etc.). monitoring of comorbidities and causative or aggravating. patient education lifestyle and dietary measures (diet, weight control, physical activity adapted to the patient’s capacity, etc.). warning signs (shortness of breath or oedema of the lower limbs, serious adverse effects of treatment) and management (timely/urgent medical consultation). references 1. chop wm, jr. extending the new york heart association classification system. jama. 1985;254:505. page 40 1/ 409acute heart failure (acute pulmonary oedema) last updated: april 2021 clinical features sudden onset or exacerbation of dyspnoea fatigue, increased time to recover after exercise bilateral peripheral oedema cold extremities elevated jugular venous pressure on auscultation: bilateral pulmonary crepitations and/or extra heart sound (gallop rhythm) signs of severity: severe respiratory distress (intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, see-saw breathing, spo < 90%, 2 etc.), cyanosis, profuse sweating, confusion systolic blood pressure < 90 mmhg (cardiogenic shock) rapid and excessive increase in arterial blood pressure (hypertensive emergency) heart rate (hr) > 130/minute or < 40/minute respiratory rate (rr) > 30/minute or < 12/minute chest pain if underlying cardiac ischemia paraclinical investigations diagnosis is mainly clinical. ecg: look for signs of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia. if available: chest x-ray: signs vary depending on the severity of pulmonary oedema. in early stage, dilation of vessels in upper lobes then perihilar haze and thickening of septa. in advanced stage, prominent opacities in hilar and perihilar regions and pleural effusion. can exclude other lung disease, such as pulmonary infection. pocus a : perform 12-zone lung exam to evaluate for signs of bilateral pulmonary oedema and/or pleural effusions. perform 5-view cardiac exam to evaluate for signs of acute volume overload and/or decreased cardiac function. monitoring: full blood count, electrolytes, serum creatinine;

iodine deficiency impairs thyroid hormone synthesis; to compensate, the thyroid gland increases in volume. thyroid function usually remains normal. as well as the development of goitre, iodine deficiency in pregnant women has serious consequences for the child (foetal and perinatal mortality, physical and mental retardation, cretinism). these risks must be prevented by providing iodine supplementation in iodinedeficient areas. clinical features the who proposes a simplified classification based on the significance of goitre: group 0: normal thyroid, no palpable or visible goitre group 1: enlarged thyroid, palpable but not visible when the neck is in the normal position group 2: thyroid clearly visible when the neck is in the normal position possible mechanical complications (rare): compression, deviation of the trachea or of the oesophagus. prevention and treatment the objective of prevention is to reduce the consequences of iodine deficiency in neonates and children. supplying iodised salt through national programmes is the recommended method of prevention. for prevention in populations living in iodine deficient areas where iodised salt is not available and for curative treatment of patients with goitre: use iodised oil, according to national protocols. for information (according to the who): iodised oil po population once yearly (190 mg capsule) children under 1 year 1 capsule children from 1 to < 6 years 2 capsules children from 6 to 15 years 3 capsules pregnant or lactating women 2 capsules or women of childbearing age curative and preventive single-doses are the same. oral treatment is preferred. the target populations are pregnant and breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age and children. in children, goitre disappears after several months. it disappears more slowly (or never) in adults despite restoration of normal thyroid function in 2 weeks. surgery is only indicated for patients with local mechanical dysfunction. page 40 4/ 409appendices appendix 1. normal daily maintenance iv fluids in children > 1 month page 40 5/ 409appendix 1. normal daily maintenance iv fluids in children > 1 month last updated: january 2021 indications basic hydration needs a for patients unable to drink sufficiently. after 48 hours, it is essential to provide nutrition to the patient orally or by nasogastric tube and to gradually reduce iv fluids. this protocol should not be used for surgical or burns patients, those with renal, cardiac disease or diabetic ketoacidosis. fluid to be administered the fluid of choice in children is ringer lactate-glucose 5% (rl-g5%). use a premixed solution if available. if not, add 50 ml of g50% to 500 ml of rl or 100 ml of g50% to 1000 ml of rl. if rl is not available, use 0.9% sodium chloride instead. for ease of prescription and administration, the daily volumes and rates in drops per minute have been rounded off. volume rate (*) weight /24 hours (paediatric infusion set 1 ml = 60 drops) 3 to < 4 kg 350 ml/24 h 15 drops/min 4 to < 5 kg 450 ml/24 h 19 drops/min 5 to < 6 kg 550 ml/24 h 23 drops/min 6 to < 7 kg 650 ml/24 h 27 drops/min 7 to < 8 kg 750 ml/24 h 31 drops/min 8 to < 9 kg 850 ml/24 h 35 drops/min 9 to < 11 kg 950 ml/24 h 40 drops/min 11 to < 14 kg 1100 ml/24 h 46 drops/min 14 to < 16 kg 1200 ml/24 h 50 drops/min 16 to < 18 kg 1300 ml/24 h 54 drops/min 18 to < 20 kg 1400 ml/24 h 58 drops/min page 40 6/ 409rate (*) rate volume weight (paediatric infusion set (standard infusion set /24 hours 1 ml = 60 drops) 1 ml = 20 drops) 20 to < 22 kg 1500 ml/24 h 63 drops/min 21 drops/min 22 to < 26 kg 1600 ml/24 h 67 drops/min 22 drops/min 26 to < 30 kg 1700 ml/24 h 71 drops/min 24 drops/min 30 to < 35 kg 1800 ml/24 h 75 drops/min 25 drops/min ≥ 35 kg 2000 ml/24 h 83 drops/min 28 drops/min (*) in a paediatric infusion set, the number of drops per minute is equal to the number of ml per hour. for example: 15 drops/min = 15 ml/hour footnotes (a) daily needs are calculated according the following formula: children 0-10 kg: 100 ml/kg per day children 11-20 kg: 1000 ml + (50 ml/kg for every kg over 10 kg) per day children > 20 kg: 1500 ml + (20-25 ml/kg for every kg over 20 kg) per day adults: 2 litres per day page 40 7/ 409main references websites consulted between june 2019 and december 2022 british national formulary (bnf) and british national formulary for children (bnfc) medicinescomplete martindale. the complete drug reference medicinescomplete uptodate. evidence-based clinical decision support resource bmj group. bmj best practice. la revue prescrire centre belge d’information pharmacothérapeutique (cbip) http://www.cbip.be/fr/start centers for disease control and prevention http://www.cdc.gov/diseasesconditions/ cochrane library world health organization http://www.who.int/publications/en/ page 40 8/ 409page 40 9/ 409
